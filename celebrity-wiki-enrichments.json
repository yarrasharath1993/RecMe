    "fullBio": "}} Konidela Chiranjeevi (; born Konidela Sivasankara Varaprasad; 22 August 1955) is an Indian actor, philanthropist and former politician known for his work in Telugu cinema. Known as Mega Star, he is widely regarded as one of the most successful and influential actors in the history of Indian cinema. Chiranjeevi holds the record for the most \"Industry Hits\" in Telugu cinema, with eight films emerging as the top-grossers of their time—a feat unmatched by any actor in the industry's 100-year history. He is also celebrated as one of the finest dancers in Indian cinema. He has received numerous honours, including the Padma Bhushan in 2006 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2024 from the Government of India, as well as the IFFI Indian Film Personality of the Year Award in 2022. His other accolades include the Raghupathi Venkaiah Award, three Nandi Awards, and nine Filmfare Awards South, including the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Honorary Award. In 2013, CNN-IBN recognized him as one of \"the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema\". In 2024, he was honoured with a Guinness World Record as the most prolific actor-dancer in the Indian film industry. Chiranjeevi made his acting debut in 1978, initially gaining recognition for his supporting, anti-hero, and antagonist roles. He later transitioned to lead roles with notable success. His breakthrough came with the 1983 film Khaidi, which became the highest-grossing Telugu film at the time and established him as a leading actor in the industry. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Chiranjeevi starred in various \"Industry Hits\"highest-grossers of all timelike Pasivadi Pranam (1987), Yamudiki Mogudu (1988), Attaku Yamudu Ammayiki Mogudu (1989), Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari (1990), Gang Leader (1991), and Gharana Mogudu (1992). prompting The Week magazine to label him \"Bigger than Bachchan\" and \"the new money machine.\" For his role in Aapadbandhavudu (1992), Chiranjeevi was paid 1.25 crore, making him the highest-paid actor in India at the time and the first Indian actor to command a remuneration in excess of 1 crore for a film. During this period, he received widespread critical acclaim for his performances in Swayamkrushi (1987), Rudraveena (1988), and Aapadbandhavudu (1992), showcasing his versatility as an actor who excelled in both commercial blockbusters and critically acclaimed films. Notably, Swayamkrushi was screened at the Moscow International Film Festival, while Rudraveena, which he co-produced, won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Chiranjeevi continued to dominate the box office with films like Master (1997), and Choodalani Vundi (1998). His 2002 film Indra was the highest-grossing Telugu film for many years, and socially impactful films like Tagore (2003) and Shankar Dada M.B.B.S. (2004) became major blockbusters, further cementing his legacy.",

He was elected as a Member of Parliament for the Congress party in 1989. In 1997, he received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award – South in addition to Honorary doctorate from Andhra University in 2008.

He debuted as a lead actor with the 1965 film Thene Manasulu and went on to star in films such as Sakshi (1967), which won critical acclaim at the Tashkent Film Festival in 1968. In 1972, he starred in Pandanti Kapuram, which garnered the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu for that year. He has essayed roles across different genres including mythological, drama, western, fantasy, action, spy, and historical films. Krishna is recognised for contributing to several technological advancements in Telugu cinema, including the first full-length Cinemascope film, Alluri Seetarama Raju (1974), and the first 70 mm film, Simhasanam (1986).

Referred to in the media as Rebel Star, he has appeared in over 24 films, and has received seven Filmfare Awards nominations, a Nandi Award, and a SIIMA Award.

In a career spanning over five decades, he has done 170 films that includes films in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Bangla, and Malayalam. He is widely regarded to be one of the most successful and popular actors in the history of Indian cinema.

Apart from acting, he has also been involved in films as a screenwriter, producer and playback singer. Siddharth is a recipient of several accolades including three Filmfare Awards South and a Tamil Nadu State Film Award. After completing his business management studies, Siddharth chose to work in film making and assisted Mani Ratnam, before going on to make an acting debut in S. Shankar's coming-of-age Tamil film Boys (2003). The success of the film provided an opportunity to feature in Mani Ratnam's multi-starrer Aayutha Ezhuthu (2004), before he branched off to receive critical and commercial acclaim in Telugu and Hindi cinema through Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana (2005), Rang De Basanti and Bommarillu (2006). The former earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. In the late 2000s, he established himself as a bankable lead actor in Telugu films and subsequently chose to become more selective with his projects, while also winning acclaim for playing a carrom player in Striker (2010) and a blind warrior in Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011). In 2011, Siddharth returned to Tamil films after a sabbatical and produced Balaji Mohan's commercially successful romantic comedy Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi (2012). The actor then had a prolific year in 2014, winning critical acclaim and box office success for his two ventures: Jigarthanda, where he portrayed an aspiring film maker, and Kaaviya Thalaivan, in which he played an actor from the 1920s Madras theater scene. The latter earned him Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor. Following few unsuccessful films, Siddharth has received commercial success with Aranmanai 2 (2016), Sivappu Manjal Pachai (2019) and Chithha (2023). Chithha earned him the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor – Tamil.",
