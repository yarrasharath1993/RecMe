## 📋 **4-PHASE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH**

All movies have been organized into **4 CSV files** for easy workflow:

| Phase | File | Movies | Time | Priority |
|-------|------|--------|------|----------|
| **1** | PHASE-1-NEEDS-HERO.csv | 25 | 2 hrs | 🚨 CRITICAL |
| **2** | PHASE-2-NEEDS-DIRECTOR.csv | 7 | 30 min | 📝 HIGH |
| **3** | PHASE-3-NEEDS-RATING.csv | 88 | 3 hrs | ⭐ MEDIUM |
| **4** | PHASE-4-READY-TO-PUBLISH.csv | 3 | 15 min | ✅ NOW |
| **TOTAL** | - | **123** | **~6 hrs** | - |

## 🚀 **PHASE-BY-PHASE WORKFLOW**

### **PHASE 1: HERO DATA (25 movies - 2 hours)** 🚨

**Why Critical:** Without hero, movies won't appear in search or profiles!

**Your Tasks:**
1. ✅ Open `PHASE-1-NEEDS-HERO.csv`
2. ✅ For each movie, research hero name on:
   - **IMDb** (most reliable)
   - **Wikipedia** (good for classics)
   - **Google** (movie name + year + "cast")
3. ✅ Fill in hero names in the CSV
4. ✅ Save your corrections
5. ✅ Send me the corrected CSV or list
6. ✅ I'll apply and publish immediately!

**Research Tips:**
- Search: `"[Movie Title]" [Year] telugu cast`
- IMDb usually lists "Stars:" section
- For old movies, check Wikipedia cast tables
- Verify the year matches!

**Expected Result:** +25 movies published → **5,431 total (98.2%)**

---

### **PHASE 2: DIRECTOR DATA (7 movies - 30 minutes)** 📝

**Why Important:** Proper attribution and film history

**Your Tasks:**
1. ✅ Open `PHASE-2-NEEDS-DIRECTOR.csv`
2. ✅ Quick lookup on IMDb/Wikipedia
3. ✅ Fill in director names
4. ✅ Send corrections
5. ✅ I'll apply and publish!

**Research Tips:**
- IMDb clearly lists "Director:" field
- Usually easy to find
- Most are well-documented films

**Expected Result:** +7 movies published → **5,438 total (98.4%)**

---

### **PHASE 3: RATING DATA (88 movies - 3 hours)** ⭐

**Why Valuable:** Quality indicators, user engagement
