## ✅ How to Record Findings

### In the CSV File

Update `MANUAL-POSTER-RESEARCH-678.csv`:

```csv
decade,year,title_en,hero,director,tmdb_id,slug,poster_url_found,source,notes
1990s,1995,"Example Movie","Hero Name","Director",12345,example-movie-1995,https://example.com/poster.jpg,google_images,"High quality"
```

**Columns to fill**:
- `poster_url_found`: Full URL of the poster image
- `source`: Where you found it (google_images, imdb, teluguone, etc.)
- `notes`: Quality (high/medium/low), any issues

---

## 🎯 Poster Quality Guidelines

### ✅ High Quality (Preferred)
- Resolution: 500px+ width
- Clear, not pixelated
- Original poster design
- Good contrast and colors
- Text readable

### 🟡 Medium Quality (Acceptable)
- Resolution: 300-500px width
- Slightly pixelated but usable
- Fan-made recreations (if well done)
- DVD/VHS covers

### ❌ Low Quality (Avoid)
- Resolution: <300px width
- Very pixelated
- Screenshots from films
- Watermarked heavily
- Wrong movie entirely

---

## 🚀 Pro Tips for Speed

### 1. Use Browser Extensions
- **Image Search Options**: Right-click search by image
- **Multiple Tab Manager**: Open 10 movies at once
- **Auto-screenshot**: Capture poster URLs quickly

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+T` - New tab
- `Ctrl+W` - Close tab
- `Ctrl+F` - Find in page
- `Ctrl+Shift+T` - Reopen closed tab

### 3. Search Patterns That Work

**For Modern Films (2000+)**:
```
"[Movie Title]" Telugu poster HD
"[Movie Title]" movie poster [Year]
[Hero Name] [Movie Title] poster
```

**For Classic Films (Pre-2000)**:
```
vintage telugu poster [Movie Title]
telugu classic cinema [Movie Title]
[Movie Title] [Year] original poster
```

**For Obscure Films**:
```
[Director Name] filmography [Movie Title]
[Hero Name] movies [Year] poster
telugu film [Year] [partial title]
```

### 4. Batch by Actor/Director
If a director made 10 films in the list:
1. Find their filmography page
2. Many posters in one place
3. Research all 10 at once

**Example**: If A. Kodandarami Reddy has 15 films in the list, find his complete filmography page and grab all posters.
