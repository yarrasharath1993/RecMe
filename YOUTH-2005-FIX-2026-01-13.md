# Youth (2005) Movie Data Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue
The movie "Youth (2005)" at `http://localhost:3000/movies/youth-2005` had **completely wrong cast and crew information**. The data appeared to be mixed up with a different movie.

## Root Cause

The database had incorrect data for Youth (2005), showing:
- **Wrong Director**: "Vinayak" (appears to be from a different Youth movie)
- **Wrong Cast**: "Nithin" and "Sharma" (not in this film)
- **Missing crew**: Writer, Cinematographer, Editor were all NULL

This was likely a data mix-up between multiple Telugu movies titled "Youth" from different years.

## Notes

### Data Mix-up Source
The incorrect data (Director: Vinayak, Hero: Nithin) suggests a confusion with another Telugu film. There may have been:
- A different "Youth" movie (possibly from 2002 or another year)
- Multiple movies with similar titles in the database
- TMDB or other source data confusion

### Recommendation
Consider adding a data validation check for movies with common titles like "Youth", "Love", "Prema" etc. to ensure correct data attribution.
