## 3. Consensus Requirements

### 3.1 Auto-Approval Rules

A fact is automatically approved when ALL of the following conditions are met:

1. **Minimum Sources:** At least 3 independent sources provide the same value
2. **Consensus Score:** ≥ 75% of sources agree on the value
3. **No Critical Conflicts:** No conflicting values from high-trust sources (≥0.9)
4. **Field Type:** The field is classified as a "fact" (not opinion or derived)

### 3.2 Manual Review Required

A fact requires manual review when:

1. **Source Conflict:** Two or more sources with trust ≥0.8 disagree
2. **Critical Field:** The field is `director`, `hero`, or `release_date`
3. **Low Consensus:** Consensus score < 75%
4. **Single Source:** Only one source available for verification

### 3.3 Conflict Severity Levels

| Severity | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Minor** | Gap > 0.4 between dominant and second value | Auto-resolve using dominant |
| **Major** | Gap 0.2-0.4 between values | Admin verification recommended |
| **Critical** | Gap < 0.2 between values | Manual review required |

## 8. Exception Handling

### 8.1 No External Source Available
When no external source exists:
1. Mark data as "internal only"
2. Set confidence to 0.5
3. Display "Unverified" indicator
4. Queue for manual verification

### 8.2 Conflicting Official Sources
When official sources conflict:
1. Flag as "critical conflict"
2. Preserve all source values
3. Require super-admin resolution
4. Document resolution reasoning

### 8.3 Retroactive Corrections
When a verified fact is later found incorrect:
1. Log the correction request
2. Compare with original sources
3. Admin reviews and approves/rejects
4. If approved, update fact and unlock temporarily
5. Re-verify from updated sources
6. Re-lock with new verification

## 9. Audit Requirements

All verification actions must be logged:

```json
{
  "action": "verify",
  "entity_type": "movie",
  "entity_id": "uuid",
  "field": "director",
  "before_value": null,
  "after_value": "S.S. Rajamouli",
  "sources": ["tmdb", "imdb", "wikipedia"],
  "consensus_score": 0.95,
  "verified_by": "auto",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-08T10:30:00Z"
}
```

---

## 10. Compliance

This verification system ensures:

1. **Zero Hallucination:** All displayed facts trace to verified sources
2. **Auditability:** Complete log of all changes and verifications
3. **Transparency:** Source attribution visible to admins
4. **Correctability:** Errors can be identified and fixed
5. **Accountability:** All actions traceable to users
