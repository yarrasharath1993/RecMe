    "synopsis": "Number One is an Italian crime-thriller film directed by Gianni Buffardi in 1973. It starred Renzo Montagnani, Luigi Pistilli, Claude Jade, Chris Avram, Guido Mannari, and Massimo Serato. The film is loosely based on a real-life story detailing crime and drugs in the Rome underground. After the film quickly disappeared from public view in 1973 due to political censorship, it was restored in 2021 and had its theatrical re-release and world premiere on television. It was distributed internationally by Variety Distribution.\n\nPlot\nBenni (Chris Avram), the owner of a photo agency, arrives. He welcomes Leo (Venantino Venantini), the owner of the club, Sylvie Boisset (Claude Jade), a French actress and model, Mino Cattani (Massimo Serato), the editor of the newspaper, Commenda (Renato Turi) and the lawyer (Paolo di Tusco). There is a lot of murmuring, and the editor of the newspaper receives a phone call. He is nervous and whispers to Leo and makes another phone call. Sylvie observes the men's interactions. At dawn in a villa in Rome: three men sit next to the body of the naked Deborah Garner (Josiane Tanzilli). Her husband, Teddy Garner Jr (Paolo Malco), is comforted by his two friends: Massimo (Guido Mannari) and Dino Pancati (Howard Ross). Shortly after, the Doctor (Andrea Aureli), arrives. He diagnoses the death and has Deborah taken away. Teddy immediately leaves Rome. Dino and Massimo go to the Capannelle, where they meet Pupo (Bruno Di Luia), the leader of a gang.\nInspector Vinci (Renzo Montagnani) starts investigating the Deborah Garner case. He interrogates all the members of Garner's entourage. The Commendatore tells him that Garner is close to a royal family, the elderly Princess (Rina Franchetti) says nothing, the lawyer turns to an art dealer (Roberto D'Ettorre Piazzoli) who is involved in the trade of stolen paintings, as well as to the director of a pawnshop who is also an accomplice. Now the case of the stolen paintings has to be investigated. Vinci now works together with the captain (Luigi Pistilli), the commander of the Carabinieri.\nThe commendatore elaborates a scam with the notary: he pretends to have bought some paintings from the legitimate owner, now deceased, a nobleman, which then ended up in Garner's house. He negotiates with the accountant (Guido Lollobrigida). There he receives a call from Pupo, who has been ordered to punish a married couple who have taken out a loan with false cheques. The husband (Andrea Scotti) is beaten, the wife (Rita Calderoni) is forced to have sex and raped by Pupo.\nNobody shows up at Debora's funeral except Sylvie, who is identified by two policemen. Sylvie calls the Carabinieri and gives them a tip-off: there are paintings stolen from the convent of Monterenzo. The carabinieri, led by the captain, find the paintings in the Monterenzo monastery and arrested the prior. When Sylvie returns home, Inspector Vinci is already waiting outside the door of her flat and questions Sylvie's Neighbour. Sylvie runs away from the house. Sylvie is visited by Benni during the night, who makes a phone call to someone called Rudy. Sylvie finds the phone call suspicious in connection with Deborah's death, the death of an American nobleman and the theft of art.\nSylvie now goes to see Massimo, who lives with his wife Betsy (Isabelle de Valvert), a model. Sylvie confides in Massimo and tells him that Benni received a phone call in his presence from the nobleman Rudy, who was involved in the theft of his uncle's painting and was in \"Number One\" during the theft so that the Commendatore would tear up some bills for his complicity in the theft.  Later, the uncle is eliminated.\nMassimo confides to Sylvie how he, along with Dino, Pupo and other crooks, had taken the paintings to the monastery. Leo was also at the scene, Massimo reveals. Massimo tells Sylvie not to be too afraid of Benni because the real criminals and dangerous villains are Leo and the Commenda.\nAfter the Captain interrogates the Commendatore, Sylvie enters his office. She is anxious and confides in him that she knows the true story of Deborah's death: In a flashback, narrated by Sylvie, we see Deborah's agony and death. She has taken the heroin and is rolling around naked ecstatically in agony on the bed, helpfully caressing herself with white foam in her mouth. Dino and Massimo advise Teddy not to save her, but to allow her inevitable death. Because the two had planned an expensive divorce. Since death takes a long time, the men play cards until Deborah is finally dead after a long agony. Because she is late, they bring the situation to Leo's attention. Leo turns to the editor and sends the three men a doctor he trusts, who ascertains Deborah's death. Sylvie tells the captain that she is worried about Massimo. She has not heard from him for four days, and he has disappeared. The captain thanks Sylvie and asks her to make herself available, because she can tip off the plot.\nThe captain arrests Dino at a poker club. The latter admits that the cocaine found in the Garner house belongs to him. He ends up in prison, where we see him as an altar boy. Massimo learns of Dino's arrest and is frightened. While having sex with Betsy, he tells her that a policeman (Emilio Bonucci) showed up while he was carrying paintings on the beach at night. The policeman was first shot and then had his throat slit. Now he wants to escape to Switzerland with Betsy. He calls his friends and asks them for money. These friends tell him to come with Betsy to a lake, the Lake Martignano. Massimo and Betsy can't wait to get all the money. Massimo is doing a photo shoot with Betsy on the shore of the lake when the two are suddenly executed with many gunshots. Both are dead.\nOn the way, a car stops next to Sylvie. Pupo jumps out, hits Sylvie and drags her into the car. The car drives away at great speed. A short time later, Pupo and his gang are eliminated by a group of assassins. They had just learned that an autopsy had been ordered on Debora to determine the true cause of death. The Captain leads Benni to the morgue, where a female corpse is found. Benni says he can't recognise her as Sylvie. The Capitano says he will keep looking for Sylvie Boisset, because he is only interested in what happened to her. Benni gets nervous, makes a phone call and threatens the caller. A bomb explodes at Number One. Then a car explodes. It turns out to have been used to transport stolen paintings. Publisher Cattani's newspaper publishes an article on the death of Massimo and Betsy: double suicide. There are no more witnesses. The two investigators attend the exhumation and discover they have no evidence against anyone.\n\nCast\nRenzo Montagnani: Vinci, Police commissioner\nLuigi Pistilli: Carabinieri commander\nClaude Jade: Sylvie Boisset\nChris Avram: Benny\nGuido Mannari: Massimo\nVenantino Venantini: Leo\nPaolo Malco: Teddy Garner Jr.\nHoward Ross: Dino Pancani\nMassimo Serato: Mino Cattani\nRenato Turi: Commenda\nRina Franchetti: Principessa\nIsabelle de Valvert: Betsy\nBruno Di Luia: Pupo\nRita Calderoni: Wife with false credit\nAndrea Scotti: Husband with false credit\nAndrea Aureli: the Doctor\n\nProduction\nNicola Campigli, to whom his late father Massimo bequeathed a fortune in pictures in 1971, is the victim of an art theft. Since Campigli has frequented Rome's jet set at Club \"Number One\", he meets the son-in-law of comedian Totò, the young film producer Gianni Buffardi. After the thieves are discovered, Campigli and Buffardi do research in the nightclub and at police stations. With a dozen Italian starlets as well as some well-known Italian actors (Venantino Venantini, Luigi Pistilli, Renzo Montagnani), the Romanian Chris Avram and the French actress Claude Jade, the crime thriller Number One was created, which premiered on May 28, 1973.\nIn an uncredited extra appearance, Eleonora Giorgi is seen in her first film appearance. She is a blonde companion in the nightclub to Commenda, played by Renato Turi.\nSince the film makes references to the then-current trials surrounding Number One and makes real people recognisable, such as the deaths of Talitha Getty and the Banda della Magliana (Magliana Gang), it was immediately withdrawn from circulation after the screening. It wasn't until 2021 that the film was restored by the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia and saw its re-release and world premiere on television.\n\nRestoration\nThe film, whose main characters are pseudonyms of partly real representatives of the jet set in Rome in the 1970s, disappears from the public. The Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia and the Cineteca Nazionale are reconstructing the film in collaboration with the television broadcaster Cine34. Roberto D'Ettore Piazzoli, the cameraman at the time, and Antonello Buffardi, the director's son, are also present. The film was shown again at the 39th Torino Film Festival in Turin in November 2021. The film will then have its television premiere on the broadcaster Cine34. Luca Pallanch from the Cineteca Nazionale said: “The good Roma, told a little earlier by Carlo Lizzani, and the bad Rome, painted by Gianni Buffardi, are two sides of the same coin that now not only offer cinephiles but also detectives in Italian history will.\"\nShortly after it was shown at the film festival, the film premiered on TV on Italian Channel Cine 34 on December 9, 2021.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nNumber One at IMDb\n\"Number One\" 2021 at Torino Film Festival, German\nNumber one at Variety Distribution"

    "synopsis": "Gorintaku is a 1979 Indian Telugu-language romantic drama film directed by Dasari Narayana Rao. It is a family sentiment film starring Sobhan Babu and Sujatha. The initial scenes of the film were shot in black and white. The title song \"Gorinta Poochindi Komma Lekunda\", written by Devulapalli Krishnasastri, casting Savitri is remembered even today. The film was remade in Hindi as Mehndi Rang Layegi.\n\nPlot\nRamu's father is a drunkard, who neglects his family. His daughter dies after he beats her once, and Ramu (Shobhan Babu) runs away from home. Ramu studies on charity, and in medical college meets Swapna (Sujatha). Ramu tutors Swapna's siblings and lives in her summer house. Swapna is married off to Anand, a London-based doctor who is already married. By the time this fact comes to light, Ramu meets Padma (Vakkalanka Padma) and falls in love. A love triangle ensues, with Swapna finally sacrificing her love and Ramu and Padma come together in the end.\n\nCast\nSobhan Babu as Ramu\nSujatha as Swapna\nSavitri\nVakkalanka Padma as Padma\nRamana Murthy\nDevadas Kanakala\nPrabhakar Reddy\nSharada\nChalam\nRama Prabha\nP.

For the role of Padma, Vakkalanka Padma, daughter of singer Vakkalanka Sarala was chosen to portray it. Actor and voice actor P.

    "synopsis": "Jaganmohini is a 1978 Indian Telugu-language film produced and directed by B. Vittalacharya. It is a remake of the 1951 Kannada film of the same name. The film stars Narasimha Raju, Prabha and Jayamalini. Jaganmohini became a major hit and even performed better than the films of big stars. The movie had the best visual effects according to Indian standards at that time.\nThis is the story of woman betrayed by a king, who reappears in her next life as a ghost intent on possessing him. On the advice of a priest, the king marries a pious woman who matches her devotional prowess against the ghost's seductions and wins.\n\nPlot\nRaja (Narasimha Raju) was a king in his previous life. When he goes to the forest once to hunt animals, he gets attracted to an orphan stick selling lady Mohini (Jayamalini) and lusts after her. He seduces her and enjoys having sex with her in the forest. After a week he leaves her in the forest itself promising that he would return to marry her and will make her his queen. But Raja is a lustful womanizer and he just betrayed Mohini. Knowing this Mohini commits suicide vowing that she will return to get him in his next life. Raja in his next birth goes to the same  forest to drink water where Jaganmohini, now a ghost, appears to him and lures him with her beauty. But he is married to another pious woman (Prabha). She regains him by praying to her Goddess, whom she believes in strongly. In the process, she is turned to into the form of an old woman and later into the form of a snake by Jaganmohini to obstruct her prayers. But, with the help of another pious ghost, and her brother-in-law, who is also turned into a sheep by Jaganmohini, she regains her original form and finishes her prayers at Srisailam.  Jagan Mohini at last gets her \"moksham\" and goes to heaven.\n\nCast\nSavitri as Raja's mother\nJayamalini as Jaganmohini\nNarasimha Raju as Raja\nPrabha as Raja's wife\nVijayalakshmi\nDhulipala Seetharama Sastry as Raja's father\nSarathi as Raja's friend\nA. Satyanarayana\nAthili Lakshmi\nMukkamala\nBalakrishna\nJayachandran\nAnita\nDuttaluri RamaRao\n\nReception\nThe Indian Express felt unlike the previous films of Vittalcharya which had clear storylines, this one was \"utterly confusing\" and called the narration incoherent while also panning the dubbing as poor, songs as unappealing and acting as miserable.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nJaganmohini at IMDb"

    "synopsis": "Sebastian Kunjukunju Bhagavathar, Thikkurissi, S. P. Pillai, Nanukuttan, Muthukulam Raghavan Pillai, Adhimoolam, B. S. Saroja, Pankajavalli'Jeevithan Nauka' is considered the first Malayalam 'mega hit' film. It was simultaneously shot in Tamil and Telugu. The success of the different versions prompted the producers to dub the film in Hindi as 'Jeevan Nauka' (1952). The Hindi version also did well.The film portrayed the life of simple folk in a small village in Kerala. The treatment is simple, straightforward and objective. At a time when most south Indian films told stories of kings and gods, 'Jeevitha Nauka' spoke of human sufferings. This was a new experience.Soman (Thikkurissi) is brought up by his elder brother Raju (Sebastian Kunjukunju Bhagavthar) and his shrewish wife Janu (Pankajavalli). Soman is in love with Lakshmi (B. S. Saroja), the daughter of a poor village performer Kaniyan (Adhimoolam) who belongs to a lower caste. Raju, employed by the Minda (Nanukuttan) and Janu resent the inter- caste marriage between Soman and Lakshmi.Lakshmi gives birth to a son and in the meanwhile Soman goes to the city in search of job. Lakshmi who is left behind in the village faces harassment at the hands of the villagers. In the city, Soman is hit by a car driven by a rich young woman who takes him home and also employs him as the manager of her estate. Janu starts receiving Soman's letters and remittances which start arriving. Janu does this by impersonating Lakshmi with the connivance of her brother Shanku (S.P.Pillai).Meanwhile Lakshmi leaves the village in search of Soman. During her wanderings Lakshmi sees her husband with a woman and suspects him of being disloyal. The young woman is none other than his employer. Lakshmi tries to kill her child and commit suicide but what saves her is the instinct of motherhood. Lakshmi gets together a band of beggars and organizes a home for them. She uses her talent as an actress and collects funds for the home by staging plays. Back in the village life turns its tables on Raju and Janu, while her brother Shanku is killed. The real culprits, the Minda's advocate and his group of people mislead the police implicating Soman in the murder. During one her plays, Lakshmi recognizes her husband who is about to be arrested on the trumped up charge. Explanations follow and Soman is absolved of the false charge and the couple are reunited. Raju is helped out by Soman. Janu who has now become a beggar is recognized by Lakshmi. Regardless of what has happened in the past, Lakshmi takes Janu home. And all ends well.There were 14 songs in the film. Music by Dakshinamoorthy followed the then prevailing trend of imitating popular Hindi tunes. Mehboob entered the cinema world by singing for this film. Though an imitation of the Mohammed Rafi song from the Hindi film 'Dulari' (1949) 'Suhani rat Dal chuki?' (Naushad), the soulful rendering by Mehboob made the song 'Akaale aarum kaividum?..' memorable. Other songs like, 'Aaanandamiyalum bale?.' (P. Leela) , 'Thoraathasru dhaara?.' (Revamma), imitations of tunes from 'Barsaat' (1949, Shanker- Jaikishen) failed to impress. A duet, 'Aanathalayolam venna tharameda?' sung by Sebastian Kunjukunju Bhagavathar and Alappuzha Pushpam, father and daughter, in real life, became a super hit.Will be remembered: Noted singer Mehboob made his film debut in this film. It will also be remembered for the songs, 'Aanathalayolam venna tharameda?' (Bhagavathar, Pushpam) and 'Vana gayike vinnil varoo nayike...' (P. Leela, Mehboob)."

    "synopsis": "Adavi Ramudu (transl. Forest Ramu)  is a 1977 Indian Telugu-language action film directed by K. Raghavendra Rao, who also wrote the screenplay. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao, Jayaprada and Jayasudha, with supporting roles played by Nagabhushanam, Satyanarayana, Gummadi and Jaggayya. The film was edited by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao, with music composed by K. V. Mahadevan and cinematography by A. Vincent.\nReleased on 28 April 1977, Adavi Ramudu received positive reviews and became an Industry Hit, running for 366 days in theatres. It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Telugu and re-established N. T. Rama Rao as a leading star in Telugu cinema. The film was a major breakthrough for director K. Raghavendra Rao, helping him gain prominence in the industry. It was the highest-grossing Telugu film of the 1970s until the record was surpassed by Premabhisekham in 1981.\n\nPlot\nDharma Raju and his son Nagaraju run a smuggling and illegal transport racket of forest produce. Ramu opposes Raju and raises awareness among the villagers to fight against him. Padma, the daughter of the local forest officer, loves Ramu. One tribal lady Chilakamma also loves Ramu as a brother. Dharma Raju takes the help of one Jaggu to send Ramu away from the forest. The second half of the film reveals that Ramu is, in fact, a forest officer in a secret mission to investigate the case of forest affairs. The story finally leads to the arrest of all criminals.\n\nCast\nN. T. Rama Rao as Ramu\nJayaprada as Padma\nJayasudha as Chilakamma\nNagabhushanam as Dharmaraju\nSatyanarayana as Nagaraju\nGummadi as Raja Shekaram\nJaggayya\nRaja Babu as Bheemanna\nSridhar as Jaggu\nMallikarjuna Rao\nMada\nPandari Bai\nRama Prabha\nKavitha\nBaby Rohini as Gowri\nShivanandakumar as Venkata Reddy\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe music was composed by K. V. Mahadevan. Lyrics were written by Veturi. The song \"Aaresukoboyi\" was recreated for the 2004 Telugu film also titled Adavi Ramudu.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\nThe success of Rajkumar's Gandhada Gudi (1972), which had a forest backdrop, inspired N. T. Rama Rao to pursue a similar theme for his next project. After the failure of Prema Bandham (1976), producers Nekkanti Veera Venkata Satyanarayana and Arumilli Suryanarayana of Satya Chitra banner approached Rama Rao to collaborate on Adavi Ramudu. They chose K. Raghavendra Rao, who had just started his directorial career and was familiar to Rama Rao from assisting Kamalakara Kameswara Rao on Pandava Vanavasam (1965). Rama Rao agreed to the project, and Jandhyala was brought in to write the script and dialogues.\n\nCasting\nJayasudha, who had worked with Raghavendra Rao on Raja (1976), was cast in a significant role, while Jayaprada, a rising star following the success of Siri Siri Muvva (1976), was chosen as the heroine. Sridhar was selected for another important role opposite Jayasudha. Jayasudha was unaware of playing a secondary role until the last minute, but since she had already agreed to do the film, she just went ahead keeping faith in Raghavendra Rao. Despite receiving positive feedback for her performance, she received letters from fans advising her to avoid second-lead roles in future films.\nAlthough Rama Rao had committed to Adavi Ramudu, he was also filming Daana Veera Soora Karna (1977) simultaneously and assured the producers that he would provide bulk dates after completing the latter project. The team proceeded with filming, confident in their cast and crew.\n\nFilming\nThe majority of the film was shot in the dense Madumalai forest, except for the opening scene, which was filmed in a Madras studio on 9 January 1977. Adavi Ramudu was the first film for which Rama Rao had given dates for more than a month (35 days) outside Madras. It also marked Rama Rao's first colour film shot in Cinemascope, using a special lens imported from Japan. Cinematographer A. Vincent, who had previously worked with Rama Rao on Sontha Vooru (1956), returned to collaborate on this film after a long break.\nDue to the remote location, the production team faced logistical challenges. With only three government guesthouses available, they built new accommodations for the 300-member cast and crew, working for 50 days to set up temporary facilities. Supplies had to be transported daily from Mysore, 250 km away.\nJayasudha recalled two accidents during filming. In one instance, both she and Jayaprada were thrown from elephants during a scene when the animals were startled by noise from junior artists. They escaped with minor injuries. In another incident, during a chase sequence, a horse cart axle broke, resulting in injuries for both actresses, requiring them to rest for a few days.\n\nRelease\nThe film was released on 28 April 1977 to positive reviews.\n\nReception\nAdavi Ramudu was a significant box office success, setting multiple records upon its release. It became the first film to collect more than ₹80 lakh in its first 50 days and the first to reach ₹1 crore within 67 days (10 weeks).\nThe film completed a 100-day run in 32 centers, a 175-day run in 16 centers, and a 200-day run in 8 centers. It ran for 302 days at Apsara Theatre in Vijayawada and achieved a full-year (365-day) run in four centers, including Hyderabad, Vizag, Tirupati, and Vijayawada. Adavi Ramudu was the first Indian film to run for a full year in four centres within a single state, breaking the previous record held by Sholay (1975), which ran for a year in three centers in Maharashtra.\nAs of 2008, it still held the record for the longest run in Secunderabad, with 161 days of continuous screenings.\n\nLegacy\nThe film re-brought N. T. Rama Rao into the league of top heroes of the Telugu Film Industry. The success of the film made K. Raghavendra Rao an established director in Telugu Cinema. The title of the film was used for a 2004 film.\n\nAwards\nFilmfare Award for Best Film - Telugu - N. V. V. Satyanarayana (1977)\nNandi Award for Best Cinematographer - A. Vincent (1977)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAdavi Ramudu at IMDb"

    "synopsis": "Kurukshetram is a 1977 Indian Telugu-language Hindu mythological film directed by Kamalakara Kameswara Rao. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Krishna, Sobhan Babu, Krishnam Raju, Jamuna, and Vijaya Nirmala. It was produced by A. S. R. Anjaneyulu, with Krishna serving as the presenter. The screenplay was written by Samudrala Jr., while the dialogues were penned by Tripuraneni Maharadhi. Notable supporting roles were played by Kaikala Satyanarayana, Anjali Devi, Jayaprada, Gummadi, and Chandra Mohan. The music was composed by Saluri Rajeswara Rao.\nThe film was shot in various locations, including Mysore and Rajasthan, and is notable for its elaborate sets and innovative production techniques, particularly for its time. Despite underperforming at the Telugu box office, Kurukshetram found success with its Hindi dubbed version. The film is recognized for its technical superiority and craftsmanship.\n\nPlot\nThe film depicts a series of key events from the Mahabharata, beginning with the division of the kingdom. It progresses through significant moments, including the marriage of Subhadra and Arjuna, the slaying of Jarasandha, the Rajasuya Yagna, the infamous dice game, the subsequent exile of the Pandavas, and culminates in the Kurukshetra War.\n\nCast\n\nJyothi Lakshmi as dancer in Mayasabha\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\nKurukshetram and Daana Veera Soora Karna were produced around the same time. Krishna began the production of Kurukshetram in parallel with N. T. Rama Rao's Daana Veera Soora Karna. He co-produced the film with A. S. R. Anjaneyulu, who had previously produced Pandava Vanavasam (1965). The film was directed by Kamalakara Kameswara Rao, with K. S. R. Das overseeing the war sequences. Samudrala Jr. wrote the screenplay, while Tripuraneni Maharadhi wrote the dialogues. Despite being a long-time associate of N. T. Rama Rao, Kameswara Rao’s decision to direct Kurukshetram caused a strain in their relationship.\n\nCasting\nIn Kurukshetram, Krishna portrayed Arjuna, while Sobhan Babu played Krishna, and Krishnam Raju took on the role of Karna. Satyanarayana appeared as Duryodhana, with Chandra Mohan as Abhimanyu, and Randhava, son of renowned wrestler Dara Singh, as Bhima. Gummadi portrayed Bhishma. Only a few actors like Satyanarayana, Gummadi, Dhulipala, and Mukkamala, appeared in both Kurukshetram and Daana Veera Soora Karna.\n\nFilming\nUnlike Daana Veera Soora Karna, which was filmed entirely at Ramakrishna Cine Studios, Kurukshetram featured elaborate sets and was shot in various locations, including Mysore and Rajasthan, and Kurukshetra in Haryana. For the war scenes, Krishna took the crew along with elephants, horses, camels, and chariots to Kurukshetra. At a time when computer-generated graphics were not available, Krishna's innovative production techniques were considered groundbreaking in the Telugu film industry.\n\nMusic\nThe music for Kurukshetram was composed by Saluri Rajeswara Rao, featuring lyrics by renowned writers such as Sri Sri, C. Narayana Reddy, Dasaradhi, Veturi, and Aarudra. Verses from Tirupati Venkata Kavulu, Karunasri, Samudrala Jr., and Joshua were also included. The film notably featured recitations from the Bhagavad Gita by Ghantasala, which were secured by Padmalaya Studios after his death. Notable songs from the soundtrack include \"Mrogindi Kalyana Veena\" and \"Dharmakshetram Idhi Kurukshetram.\"\n\nReception\nDespite underperforming at the Telugu box office, Kurukshetram received some appreciation in Bangalore, while its Hindi dubbed version achieved significant success. The film is recognized for its technical superiority and innovative production techniques, showcasing Krishna's dedication. However, critics felt that Krishna and Sobhan Babu's portrayals of Arjuna and Krishna did not resonate as strongly as N. T. Rama Rao's previous performances, which was seen as a disadvantage for Kurukshetram. In contrast, Satyanarayana's portrayal of Duryodhana received praise, reminiscent of S. V. Ranga Rao's powerful performances in similar roles. In retrospect, while Daana Veera Soora Karna became a blockbuster, Kurukshetram is noted for its ensemble cast and production quality.\n\nExternal links\nKurukshetram at IMDb\n\nReferences"

    "synopsis": "Seetha Kalyanam is a 1976 Indian Telugu-language Hindu mythological film directed by Bapu from a screenplay written by Mullapudi Venkata Ramana. It is an adaptation of Ranganatha Ramayanam in Telugu. Based on the Bala Kanda, the ensemble cast film relates events from the birth of Lord Rama, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu, up to his wedding to Seetha, incarnation of Lakshmi.\nThe film won the Filmfare Award for Best Direction (Telugu). It was screened at the BFI London Film Festival, Chicago International Film Festival, San Reno and Denver International Film Festivals in 1978, and is part of the course work at the British Film Institute.\n\nPlot\nGranted several boons by the gods Brahma and Shiva, Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, uses his many powers to plague all creation, notably molesting women, many of whom he kidnaps. At the appeal of the gods and the sages, Vishnu assures them that he shall take an incarnation as a mortal, as the arrogant Rakshasa had never sought protection from men (or apes).\nThe goddess Lakshmi chooses to accompany her divine consort, first as the ascetic Vedaavati (who is insulted by Ravana), then as a baby who appears from a golden lotus in Ravana’s own palace in Lanka, and finally as the child who is discovered when Janaka, king of Videha, is performing the ritual of ploughing the ground before a sacrifice.\nThe film then describes the events that reunite the divine couple, stringing along the way various tales, in song and dance form, from the Rāmāyana that are tangentially related to the main narrative, including the creation of Lord Shiva’s bow, Vishnu’s avatar as Vamana, and the descent of the Ganga.\nThe movie ends with Parasurama, Visvamitra, and Vasishta being granted a vision of Rama, Seetha, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna in their true, celestial, forms.\n\nCast\nRavi Kumar as Lord Vishnu / Lord Rama\nJaya Prada as Goddess Lakshmi / Goddess Seetha\nGummadi as Dasharatha\nKanta Rao as Narada\nMikkilineni as Janaka\nMukkamala as Vishwamitra\nKaikala Satyanarayana as Ravana\nDhulipala as Vashistha\nTyagaraju as Parashurama\nHemalata as Kausalya\nJamuna as Kaikeyi\nP.

    "synopsis": "Bhale Dongalu is a 1976 Indian Telugu-language action drama film directed by K. S. R. Das and produced under Trimurti Productions. The film stars Krishna and Manjula, with Mohan Babu, Prabhakar Reddy, Padmanabham, and Nagabhushanam in supporting roles. The music was composed by Satyam. It is a remake of the 1974 Hindi film Chor Machaye Shor.\nThe film follows Sekhar, an engineer wrongfully imprisoned, who escapes with fellow inmates and finds himself in a remote village entangled in a web of danger and corruption. Notably, Bhale Dongalu was the first Telugu film to be made in Fujicolor. It was a commercial success.\n\nPlot\nEngineer Sekhar is falsely accused of attempting to assault a woman and is sentenced to prison despite proclaiming his innocence. While in jail, he initially clashes with Ranga, a fellow inmate, but the two eventually reconcile and form a close bond. Sekhar also befriends Chinna and Gunna, two petty thieves serving time. During his imprisonment, Sekhar reflects on his love for Rekha, a wealthy woman, and the societal class differences that separated them. Rekha's father, along with a corrupt politician, Kanaka Rao, conspired to frame Sekhar, leading to his imprisonment.\nDetermined to prove his innocence, Sekhar escapes from prison with the help of his newfound friends. Reuniting with Rekha, he uncovers the conspiracy orchestrated by her father and Kanaka Rao. Together, Sekhar and Rekha, accompanied by his prison companions, arrive in Santhi Nagar, a remote village. Mistaken for political representatives sent to improve the village, they are warmly welcomed by the locals. Embracing their new roles, the group works to uplift the community and protect it from a gang of bandits who have long terrorized the villagers.\nThe bandits, in collaboration with Kanaka Rao, plot to eliminate Sekhar and his allies. A fierce conflict ensues, with Sekhar, his friends, and the villagers joining forces to defeat the bandits. The battle ultimately exposes Kanaka Rao's misdeeds, leading to his arrest and the restoration of peace in Santhi Nagar. The story concludes with harmony returned to the village.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\nThe film was produced by G. Sambasiva Rao and P. Babji on Trimurti Productions banner. The dialogues were written by Bhamidipati Radhakrishna. Notably, it was shot in Fujicolor, making it the first Telugu film to use this technology.\n\nMusic\nThe film's soundtrack, composed by Satyam, features lyrics by Dasaradhi, Aarudra, Kosaraju, and Gopi. One of the songs is adapted from the original Hindi film Chor Machaye Shor.\n\n\"Vachadu Choodu Varasainavadu\" – Adapted from \"Le Jayenge Le Jayenge\"\n\"Pandanti Chinnadira\"\n\"Andamaina Chinnavada\"\n\"Chusane Olammi Chusane\" – Sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and P. Suseela\n\"Kandalu Pindi Panichesthe\"\n\nReception\nAndhra Patrika gave a positive review of the film, praising its production values, the performances of Krishna and Mohan Babu, Bhamidipati's witty dialogues, and K. S. R. Das's direction. In contrast, Andhra Bhoomi provided a negative review, criticizing Das's direction, the use of Fujicolor, the loudness of the songs, and the background music. However, the performance of Mohan Babu received appreciation.\nThe film was successful at the box office. Mohan Babu's catchphrase in the film \"Chikkar Mein Rakka\" gained popularity with audiences.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBhale Dongalu at IMDb"

Upon learning of this, the tycoons, especially Mr & Mrs.Karunakaram, begrudge the decision as they aspire to arrange their daughter Prameela's marriage with Raja Shekaram. So, they ploy & split Jayanti, showing menace to Raja Shekaram. Parallelly, Jayanthi's grandmother also passes away when she quits. Now, Mr. Moneybags creates notoriety as if she eloped, but Dr. Vijayalakshmi shelters Jayanti as a governess to her infants. Plus, her younger sibling Prasad also wants to nuptial Jayanti, which she accepts. Meanwhile, Prameela elopes with a guy, Sivaram, when the big shots are mortified and plead pardon from Raja Shekaram. Surprisingly, to the wheel of fortune, Prasad happens to be Raja Shekaram's bestie. Right now, Raja Shekaram learns about the espousal of Prasad & Jayanth, so he calmly leaves the place. At last, Prasad & Vijayalakshmi are aware of the fact and retrieve Jayanti. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Raja Shekaram & Jayanti.\n\nCast\n\nCrew\nArt: G. V.

    "synopsis": "Samsaram (transl. Family) is a 1975 Indian Telugu-language drama film, produced and directed by T. Prakash Rao under the Anil Productions banner. It stars N. T. Rama Rao and Jamuna. The music was composed by T. Chalapathi Rao.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with an ideal couple, Raghava Rao & Lalitha, blessed with two children, Shekar & Lakshmi. Since they have knitted without the approval of Lalitha's father, advocate Pratap Rao, he hostiles them. Parallelly, Raghava works in a firm owned by Bhupati, where he unfolds the scam of his brother-in-law, General Manager Satyam. Discerning it, Bhupati switches Raghava Rao as a substitute for Satyam, which begrudges him. Raghava Rao is in high society, which compels him to drink, leading to family conflicts.\nMeanwhile, Satyam maintains an affair with secretary Nalini, whom her illiterate cousin Chandram endears, and she belittles him. As of now, Nalini conceives and pressurizes Satyam to espouse. Hence, he slays her and incriminates Raghava Rao. Though Chandram witnesses it, he is feeble as dumb. Lingam, Satyam's henchman, catches a photograph of the crime and clutches him. Currently, Pratap Rao sentences life to Raghava Rao. Lalitha, who affirms her husband as a convict, quits and joins as a tutor at a college, where its principal, Raja Rao, nurtures her as a sister. \nYears roll by, and Raghava Rao acquits, unbeknownst, joins as a gardener at Raja Rao's residence and spots Lalitha.

Gopi becomes a sincere cop, and the government appoints him to check these hoods. Meanwhile, Shekar gets acquainted with a girl named Latha, a gangbanger. Now, Shekar is behind her, and Gopi shadows the two. After a while, Shekar & Latha crush. Plus, he learns she is dragged into this syndicate with force,   headed by two malicious Ranga & Sarkar, one that feigns as honorable. Here, Shekar ensures the safeguarding of Latha, so he, too, affiliates with the gang and works as a double agent for Gopi. Once in a bust, Vasu, Ranga's son, is caught. At the same time, Ranga & Sarkar discovers that Shekar has avenged the homicides of his father, i.e., themselves, and regarding his younger sibling.

The film was remade in Hindi as Jeevan Jyoti (1976).\n\nPlot\nRaja Rao Bahadur (Kanta Rao) is the head of a wealthy and charitable landlord family who has a young son Sreedhar. At his son's request, Rao helps his college friend (Hari) with the costs of higher education abroad. Hari is grateful and invites Sreedhar to his sister Laxmi's (Sangeeta) wedding in the village. Due to unusual circumstances, Sreedhar ends up marrying Lakshmi. This enrages Mukkamala who is the Raja's brother-in-law, who was hopeful of getting his daughter (Jaya Malini) married to Sreedhar.\nWhat makes matters worse is that Laxmi wins over the royal household with her humility and good nature while Sreedhar falls in love with her innocence. She accidentally discovers a stash of the estate jewels in a well. Joginatham and Mukkamala try to implicate the Priest. Laxmi suggests that since they do not know conclusively as to who stole jewels, they should spare the Priest. Mukkamala, at the suggestion of the estate manager Joginatham (Allu Ramalingiah), then approaches Contractor (Rao Gopala Rao). Contractor agrees to break up the couple. But Contractor eyes the entire estate and its valuables and he entrap Mukkamala. He uses Kishtaiyya (Nutan Prasad) and creates suspicion in Sreedhar's mind with a sinister plan. Sreedhar falls prey to his doubts, comes to the conclusion that Laxmi is cheating on him and is only interested in his wealth.\nHe sends off pregnant Laxmi with all the family jewels. Laxmi gives the jewels off to Joginatham and decides to end her life. She is rescued by the Priest at whose house she gives birth to twins (a boy and a girl). Meanwhile, back at the estate, Sreedhar is depressed and loses interest in life and curses out Mukkamala when he proposes that Sreedhar should marry his daughter. The contractor then fixes up Kishtayya with Jaya Malini and proceeds to squeeze Mukkamala out of his money. After that, he takes possession of several antiques that Joginatham was trying to sell.\nAll that's left is the Deity's Jewels. The Raja who is distraught with the whole lifeless situation of the estate decides to leave the Deity's Jewels in the temple itself and wanders the villages. He stumbles upon Laxmi's kids (his grandkids), discovers the truth and requests Laxmi to come back. Laxmi refuses to come back and declares that this does not work with recommendations and that Sreedhar himself has to accept his mistake and come to her and ask her to come back. The Raja with the help of the kids and Sreedhar's friend hatch a plan to set things right with Sreedhar and beat the Contractor at his own game.\n\nCast\nSangeeta as Lakshmi, Sreedhar's wife\nSreedhar as Sreedhar, Raja's son\nKanta Rao as Raja Rama Dasu\nRao Gopal Rao as Contractor\nAllu Ramalingaiah as Joginadham\nMukkamala as Raja's brother-in-law\nSakshi Ranga Rao\nNutan Prasad as Kishtayya\nJayamalini as Kistayya's wife\nSuryakantam as Contractor's wife\nPisupati Venkateswara Rao as temple Pujari\nMada\nArja Janardhana Rao as Hanuman\n\nProduction\nThe movie was shot mostly outdoors in the Gyan Bagh Palace in Hyderabad and on the Pulidindi Canal.\n\nSoundtrack\n\"Entati Rasikudavo Teliseraa\"\nLyrics by C.

    "synopsis": "Deeksha (transl. Initiation) is a 1974 Indian Telugu-language drama film, produced by Koganti Kutumba Rao and Vajje Subba Rao under the Sri Padmaja Films banner and directed by K. Pratyagatma. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Jamuna, and music composed by Pendyala Nageswara Rao.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins in a village where a farmer, Ramaiah, lives delightfully with his wife Shanthamma, son Raja, and daughter Kamala, who devotedly cultivates his ancestor's land. Zamindar Jaganadham ruses to acquire it and lures Ramaiah a lot, but in vain. So, he squats it with forgery, which leads to Ramaiah's death. Before dying, he takes an oath from Raja to retrieve their land, which turns into his essence of life. Here, Raja onslaughts on Jaganadham when he locks him in a room. At this, Raja spots Linga Murthy, the elder of Jaganadham, who arrived from abroad as a prisoner for the diamonds, i.e., his lifetime effort. Forthwith, he uncovers the secret, requests Raja to hand it over to his family, and passes away. Now, he absconds to the city with his family and becomes a mechanic. In the interim, Linga Murthy's family lands in quest of him, and Jaganadham boots them. \nYears roll by, and Raja is invariable to his aim, who is acquainted with a florist, Malli, and they crush. After a while, he detects her as a cash-rich Rani, likewise, the daughter of Jaganadham. Thus, Raja loathes her enragedly when Rani affirms the actuality. Indeed, she is surrounded and perturbed by many guys to usurp her wealth. Once Rani spotted & adored Raja's rectitude, she designed the game to gain his love. Listening to it, Raja also reciprocates. Parallelly, Brahmanandam, the heir of Linga Murthy, is a petty thief. However, he stands for integrity, just as Robin Hood does. Kamala discerns his altruism and loves him. Once, Raja nets Brahmanandam when he holdups but excuses him, anticipating his mother's virtue. In tandem, Raja picks up Linga Murthy's treasure and holds it. \nLater, he gets to know Brahmanandam as Kamala's beloved and opposes it when a rift arises between the siblings. Anyhow, wise to Brahmanandam's virtue, Raja proceeds with the proposal, detecting him as Linga Murthy's son. Raja delivers the diamonds, divulging his father's death. Consequently, he shares half with him. Presently, Raja & Brahmanandam, in disguise, seek vengeance against Jaganadham. Meanwhile, Jaganadham molests a penniless Seeta, who commits suicide. So, to teach him a lesson, Raja plays with Rani's fidelity. Here, Jaganadham is frightened to recognize Raja as Ramaiah's son, who has recoupled his land. Plus, Rani also moves to avenge Raja for ruining her self-esteem. Forthwith, Jaganadham onslaughts, and Raja cease him. At last, Rani is on the verge of killing Raja, as she perceives his integrity. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Raja & Rani.\n\nCast\nN. T.

    "synopsis": "Nippulanti Manishi (transl. Fire-like Man) is a 1974 Indian Telugu-language action film directed by S. D. Lal and produced by Y. V. Rao. It stars N. T. Rama Rao and Latha, with music composed by Satyam. A remake of the Hindi film Zanjeer (1973), it became a silver jubilee hit and played a role in revitalizing Rama Rao's career. Following its success, Rama Rao acted in additional remakes of popular Amitabh Bachchan films, including Neram Nadi Kadu Akalidi (1976), which was also produced by Y. V. Rao.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with Pratap acquitting from jail for marketing duplicate drugs. Thereupon, an Inspector sues him to reform, which he deaf ears. Later, Pratap repents, discerning that his daughter also became a victim. So, he decides to quit the profession. Being conscious of it, his chieftain, Jagadish Chandra Prasad, slaughters him & his wife. Witnessing it, their son Vijay avenges and the single lead that arouses him is homicide's horse chain to the wrist. Years roll by, and Vijay turns into a sincere & valiant cop, intimidating criminals. Presently, he encounters a notorious criminal, Sher Khan, who is generous & warm. Before long, a brawl erupts between them, and Sher Khan is defeated. Whereat, he turns his way of life, and they become besties. Parallelly, a stranger, David, consistently informs Vijay regarding the rackets of Jagadish Chandra Prasad. \nErgo, Vijay hinders him, and when to thwart him, he bids to bribe him but fails. In a chase, a lorry perpetrates an accident, leaving several children dead, which is spotted by a street performer, Lakshmi, who identifies the culprit. So, she is stroked by blackguards when Vijay shelters her, and the two crush. Eventually, Jagadish Chandra Prasad falsely incriminates Vijay and sentences him. Soon after the release, Vijay is vengeful against him when Lakshmi deters it. Meanwhile, Vijay meets David, who affirms his root cause is the son's death because of the hooch made by this gang. Right now, he conglomerated all the evidence against them—depressed, Vijay steps back, torn between his desire and promise, when Lakshmi upholds her vow. At last, Vijay, mingling with Sher Khan, ceases. Jagadish Chandra Prasad recognizes him as the butcher of his parents. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note, with Vijay regaining his honor & position.\n\nCast\nSource\n\nN. T.

    "poster_url": "https://archive.org/download/Devadasu_1974_Review/__ia_thumb.jpg",
    "synopsis": "Devadasu is a 1974 Telugu romance film, with Krishna in the titular roll and directed by Vijaya Nirmala, who also plays Parvati, in her 100th film in lead role. It is based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's Devdas, produced by S. Raghunath and presented by Krishna under the Sri Vijaya Krishna Movies banner, with music was composed by Ramesh Naidu. Kotagiri Gopala Rao edited the film, while V. S. R. Swamy provided the cinematography. The film was a commercial failure at the box office.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins at the village Ravulapalli, where two infant neighbors, Devadas & Parvati, share a camaraderie. He is the son Zamindar Narayana Rao, and she is a peasant Neelakantham’s daughter. Since Devadas’s naughtiness increases, his father enrolls him in a boarding school. Years roll by, and Devadas backs when Parvati is under beatitude as the astral love rises with them. Knowing it, Zamindar warns & mortifies Neelakantham about their low level of caste & status. Enraged, Neelakantham declares to get hitched above them. Parvati covertly walks to Devadas that night and begs him not to let go of her when he asks for time. \nThe following day, he affirms his decision to Zamindar but loses the ability as his father shows the danger of suicide. Ergo, muddle Devadas, flies to the town and notifies Parvati of his failure to denote. Parallelly, Neelakantham arranges an aged alliance with Zamindar of Durgapuram, Bhavana Babu, which Parvati accepts. Till then, Devadas regrets & retrieves, telling Parvati he is bolder for espousal. She rejects it as her self-reverence is offended and presides over the wedding of her father’s choice. Devastated, Devadas returns when his carousing mate Bhagawan introduces him to a courtesan Chandramukhi for relief. Nevertheless, his suffering is intense, and he loathes, throwing money in her face. At that moment, she feels a sense of worship, ends her past, and devotes herself to him. \nThus, Devadas hits the bottle to get out of grief and turns into an alcoholic. Hearing it, his father passes away under contrite when Devadas forwards. Parvati settles into her new house, adores her husband, revives his disintegrated family, and showers motherly affection to his progeny. Currently, she visits her parents’ home and implores Devadas to stop drinking but pleads not to withdraw a little peace. Plus, she seeks to bless his ministry, which he bestows to fulfill before leaving his breath. Now, he is back in town again when lonesome Devadas journeys to Chadramukhi. He views her relinquishing all luxuries and expresses her adoration for him. Chadramukhi petitions Devadas to knit a fine match and post her as their maid. Then, Devadas states that if he does so, he will tie the knot only with her. \nFollowing this, he starts self-destruction as a drinking spree, and his health deteriorates. Once, spotting him on the streets, Chandramukhi carries him when the doctor declares it’s his last stage. On his advice, Devadas leaves for his village. Chandramukhi is about to join him, which he denies with an oath to conjoin her in his next life. Midway, Devadas discerns his fast-approaching death and moves to Durgapuram to keep up his vow. After great difficulty, Devadas lands at his destination and becomes flat before Parvati’s residence. At last, mindful of his death, Parvati rushes towards the door, which her family members thwart by closing it, and she collapses. Finally, the movie ends with Devadas’s funeral.\n\nCast\n\nSoundtrack\nSoundtrack composed by Ramesh Naidu is owned by Saregama music label. Lyrics were written by Aarudhra.\n\nReception\nDevadasu was released on 6 December 1974. It opened with a tepid response in theatres. In 2022, Srivathsan Nadadhur of OTT Play wrote, \"There are several theories surrounding the film's non-performance at the ticket window. While some claim that the film neither offered any new insight into the novel nor had any pathbreaking performances, another reason behind its failure is believed to be the re-release of ANR's Devadasu at the same time, that proved counterproductive to its fortunes.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDevadasu at IMDb"

It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Latha   and music composed by K. V. Mahadevan. The film is based on Mullapudi Venkata Ramana's Janata Express (novel). The film is the debut to veteran artists Nutan Prasad and Latha. The film won two Nandi Awards. The film has given enthusiastically drawing atmosphere and spirit to the movie Godavari (2006), directed by Sekhar Kammula.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins in the Panchavati colony where people of various mindsets reside. Seetarama Rao / Ramu is an orphan raised by an old lady, Seetamma, who lives alone. Everyone in the colony holds Ramu dear; in turn, he treats them as his family members. Once, Ramu's briefcase is exchanged at the railway station with another containing a vast amount belonging to a multi-millionaire JB Rao. JB is a marionette in the hands of his secretary, who loathes the penniless. Ramu safely returns the briefcase to him when he is accused of theft, but Seeta, the only daughter of JB Rao, likes Ramu's ideologies and falls for him. Meanwhile, Seetamma completes RamaKoti for her son's wealth absconded in childhood and aspires to visit Bhadrachalam to submit it to the Lord. At the same time, Ramu is appointed Deputy Collector at Bhadrachalam, but he wants to maintain secrecy regarding his job till the end of the destination. Meanwhile, the secretary's ploy with JB's nephew Giri spoils JB's mindset, and he conspires to couple up Seeta with Giri at the same Bhadrachalam. Ramu starts his pilgrimage along with his entire colony in a Janatha Boat. JB and the party also accompany them in a luxury boat. Besides, a suspended Tahsildar Ramalingam, a sly, arrives with a Govt. boat for the Deputy Collector to pamper and retrieve his position. All 3 are joined, and the journey begins, which takes several twists and turns. In between an awful incident, Seetamma passes away when they try to stop the boats for the funeral, JB insults her to throw her into the river Godavari as it is a waste of time. Here, furious Ramu wants to teach a lesson to JB, so he makes a play by hiding the boats and pretends as if they have been flooded away. Now, they halt on an island where Ramu arranges food for colony members. Eventually, JB's group is starving, and no one comes forward to sell or share their food when JB realizes that money cannot do everything. So, he says sorry to Ramu and embraces all of them. Surprisingly, it is revealed that JB is Seetamma's absconded son. Knowing it, he repents and collapses when the secretary seeks to kill him, and Giri tries forcibly to espouse Seeta when JB understands the nefariousness of his henchmen. At last, Ramu rescues Seeta, stops the baddies, and affirms that he is the newly appointed Deputy Collector. Finally, the movie ends happily with Ramu & Seeta's marriage.\n\nCast\n\nMusic\n\nMusic was composed by K. V. Mahadevan.

    "synopsis": "Beedala Patlu (transl. The Plight of the Poor) is a 1972 Indian Telugu-language drama film, produced and directed by B. Vittalacharya. It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Krishna Kumari, with music composed by K. V. Mahadevan. The film is based on the 1862 French novel Les Misérables, written by Victor Hugo.\n\nPlot\nDuring the Pre-independence era, Kotaiah steals a loaf of bread to feed his young niece. The judiciary sentences him to 2 months. Once, his niece visits, announcing her mother's death when she attempts to abscond but is caught, and his imprisonment increases to five years, which extends; in total, Kotaiah spends 12 years in prison. Shanta Kotaiah's niece is knitted to Ram Gopal, and they have a baby girl, Padma. Ram Gopal, who is in bad company and a crook, gets her to part with all her jewelry and disappears with it. Meanwhile, Kotaiah, on release from jail, has been told by the jail authorities, including Inspector Javert, a ruthless Police officer, to keep them informed about his whereabouts and to present himself regularly at the police station. When he returns to his locality, he cannot find Shanta, and the neighbors drive him away, calling him a dacoit. Kotaiah turns over a new leaf with the help of a Christian Bishop, who helps him realize himself and introduces himself as Dayanidhi, who becomes the successful mayor of his town. Once Kotaiah meets up with Shanta on her deathbed and before dying, she hands over Padma's responsibility to Kotaiah. Meanwhile, Inspector Javert discovers his new life and constantly threatens to expose him. Time passes, and the grown Padma falls in love with Arun Kumar, a freedom fighter. In a fight between the revolutionaries and the police, Javert is imprisoned by them, but subsequently, Kotaiah saves Javert's life. Javert commits suicide, unable to turn Kotaiah in to the authorities out of gratitude. Simultaneously, Arun Kumar gets injured by British Police. Kotaiah comes to his rescue. When Arun Kumar recovers, they will also identify Ram Gopal. Finally, the movie ends with the marriage of Arun Kumar & Padma, and Kotaiah breathes his last happily.\n\nCast\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao as Kotayya / Dayanidhi / K V Purushottam\nKrishna Kumari as Shantha\nV.

    "synopsis": "Raithu Bidda (transl. Son of the farmer/soil) is a 1971 Indian Telugu-language drama film directed by B. A. Subba Rao. It stars N. T. Rama Rao and Vanisri, and the soundtrack was composed by S. Hanumantha Rao. It was produced by Kotla Venkata Ramayya under the Lakshmi Kala Films banner.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins in a village where a Zamindar late, Jagapati Rao, splices Lakshmi Devi after the death of his wife. Ramu, a valiant progeny of the first devoted to Lakshmi Devi, coddles his half-brother, Prasad. Plus, he takes care of family tasks and toils to ameliorate the lifestyles of the destitute. Besides, Bhushaiah, a vitriolic loan shark, is a tyrant, and Ramu impedes his enormities where animosity arises. Meanwhile, Shanta, a schoolteacher, plugs away to civilize the public. Ramu & Shanta mutually admire their ideologies and fall in love. Shanta lives with her father, Dharmaiah, a bucolic, and sister, Sarada. Pullaiah, the husband of Sarada, is a forthright used to thwart Bhushaiah. So, he postured him as an impostor, which Dharmaiah also believed, and he was ostracized.\nMeanwhile, Prasad crushes on Radha, the benevolent daughter of Bhushaiah. Being conscious of it, Ramu proceeds to fix up the match for the ardor of his brother: Whereat, Bhushaiah ruses for a share of joint assets, which Lakshmi Devi denies. Hence, Prasad approaches Panchayati owing to Bhushayya's vitiate. Ergo, Ramu abandons the totality to Prasad and pledges celibacy due to his heir staying away from claiming the share tomorrow, which Shanta also respects. Following, Ramu exits the house, resides with peasants, and forms an association of combined farming with the aid of Shanta. Here, infuriated Bhushaiah intrigues by incriminating Ramu for a heist of society amount, but Lakshmi acquits him by retrieving it. At this point, everyone denounces Ramu, which makes him quit the village. In between, he encounters Pullaiah when the two mingle to check Bhushaiah's trespass. Aside from that, Bhushaiah molds Prasad as a tippler backstab, snatching his property and opting to auction it. He also conspires to knit Shanta in return for Dharmaiah's debt. Ramu ceases Bhushaiah and shields Shanta with their family's prestige in various disguises. At last, Prasad requests Ramu to take back his oath. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Ramu & Shanta.\n\nCast\nN. T. Rama Rao as Ramu\nVanisri as Santha\nJaggayya as Prasad\nRajanala as Pullayya\nSatyanarayana as Bhushayya\nAllu Ramalingaiah as Seshayya\nRaja Babu as Yellayya\nSridhar as District Collector\nCh.

Ramachandra Rao under the Viswa Bharathi Productions banner and directed by K. Pratyagatma. It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Jamuna, with music composed by T. Chalapathi Rao. Kamal Haasan worked under Thangappan as his dance assistant in this film.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with two good friends, Shekaram, a wealthy man, & Chalapati, an intelligent alcoholic. They also fix the alliance of their infant Raja & Radha, and the two grow with camaraderie. Once Chalapati detects Mica in his land when Shekaram invests his totality for his mate, they start the business and succeed. Tragically, Chalapati dies soon after in an accident. Exploiting it, Chalapati's sly sibling Kaasulamma ruses by clutching the authority as Raja's guardian, mingling with Manager Krishnappa, and henpecking her husband, Hanumantu. They also bankrupted Shekaram, and as a result, he quits the town. Years pass, and Kaasulamma molds Raja as a debaucher and enjoys proprietary. Currently, Shekaram & Radha have returned as they wish to view Raja. Hereupon, Radha cracks up with Raja's deplorable state. Thus, she aims to reform him, who triumphs with her tenacity. Whereat, Raja comprehends his aunt's obliquity and hinders her oppressions & atrocities by seizing power. Simultaneously, Raja asserts to knit Radha, despite Kaasulamma's denial. So, she plots with Krishnappa to slay Raja for a crash in which he is declared dead. Startling, a rough identical to Raja lands with evidence, but everyone suspects him of being a forge, including Radha. Following, he mocks the schemers. At last, as a flabbergast, it unveils that Raja has survived with his uncle Hanumanthu's aid, and the plotters are apprehended. Finally, the movie ends happily with the marriage of Raja & Radha.\n\nCast\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao as Raja\nJamuna as Radha\nGummadi as Sekharam\nRamana Reddy as Hanumanthu\nRaja Babu as Babji\nRaavi Kondala Rao as Kishtappa\nSakshi Ranga Rao as Guruji\nJ.

    "synopsis": "Mosagallaku Mosagadu (transl. Deceiver of deceivers) is a 1971 Indian Telugu-language revisionist Western film directed by K. S. R. Das and written by Aarudra. Produced by G. Adiseshagiri Rao under the banner of Sri Padmalaya Films, the film features Krishna, Vijaya Nirmala, Nagabhushanam, Kaikala Satyanarayana, Gummadi, Dhulipala, M. Prabhakar Reddy, and Jyothi Lakshmi in prominent roles.\nInspired by classic Western films, Mosagallaku Mosagadu is set in the 18th century, during the anarchy following the 1757 Battle of Bobbili. The film combines historical elements with a fictional treasure hunt narrative, focusing on the search for lost treasure belonging to the Amaraveedu dynasty. It was notable for its use of Eastmancolor, marking a technical milestone for Telugu cinema, and was shot in various locations including Bikaner, Shimla, and the Thar Desert.\nReleased on 27 August 1971, Mosagallaku Mosagadu achieved major success, running for 100 days in multiple theatres. Considered the first Western made in India, it established Krishna as the first Telugu \"cowboy\" and sparked a wave of similar productions in Telugu cinema. The film was subsequently dubbed into Tamil as Mosakkaaranukku Mosakkaaran, released in a Hindi version, and also presented in a trimmed English version title Treasure Hunt. Its success also influenced the adoption of the Western genre in Hindi films.\n\nPlot\nIn the 18th century, the aftermath of the Battle of Bobbili (1757) is a period marked by political chaos and the intervention of British and French forces in South India. Hidden treasure of the Amaraveedu dynasty is concealed in a cave with five doors. To keep the treasure from falling into the hands of the British, two friends, Daanaala Dharmayya and Pagadaala Subbayya, hide it far away and secure it with five keys. Daanaala Dharmayya escapes to Kurnool, while Pagadaala Subbayya flees to Gadwal. The friends separate to keep the keys and the treasure safe.\nKrishna Prasad, a social reformer who fights for the rights of the poor against the new government, encounters Nakkajittula Naaganna, a highway robber, who is captured and offered a reward of 1,000 gold coins for his capture. Krishna Prasad seizes the opportunity to earn money and help the poor by capturing Naaganna. He secures Naaganna with ropes and turns him in, but secretly frees him to share the loot. Krishna uses the money to aid the poor, which earns him a reputation and support from the local community.\nOne day, a blind man, a former servant of the Amaraveedu court who knows the location of the treasure keys, accidentally reveals this information at a highway tavern. Sathyam, a rival seeking the treasure, tortures the blind man for details about the keys. Sathyam learns about Daanaala Dharmayya in Kurnool, but kills him in his haste. Radha, Dharmayya's daughter, discovers her father dying and, misled into believing Pagadaala Subbayya is responsible for the murder, seeks revenge.\nPagadaala Subbayya, on his deathbed due to old age, reveals the treasure's location to his son and mentions that he had given the keys to Komarayya, a retired constable in Kurnool. Meanwhile, Krishna Prasad continues to earn money through his schemes involving Naaganna. He falls in love with Radha, whom he trains as a sharpshooter to help her seek revenge. Radha swears to avenge her father's death.\nRadha's pursuit of revenge leads to conflicts with Bijili, a rival cowgirl who also falls for Krishna. When Naaganna attempts to steal Krishna's loot, Krishna punishes him by leaving him stranded in the desert. Naaganna, holding a grudge, joins forces with Bijili. During a confrontation in the desert, Naaganna and Bijili capture and torture Krishna. They discover a cart of corpses, among which is Pagadaala Subbayya's son. The son reveals the treasure's secret to Krishna.\nDriven by greed, Naaganna adopts the identity of Pagadaala Subbayya and helps Krishna recover from his injuries. Krishna and Radha eventually escape together. Naaganna, now disguised as Subbayya, is later captured by Sathyam's gang. Krishna rescues him, and Naaganna becomes his ally once more. Radha reveals that her father used to work for Constable Komarayya, who had received one of the keys from Daanaala Dharmayya.\nKrishna Prasad, Radha, and Naaganna journey to the treasure cave. A fierce battle ensues between Krishna's group and rival robbers seeking the treasure. After defeating the robbers, Krishna discovers the five sacks of treasure. He and Radha share the treasure, fulfilling their quest and restoring justice.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\nFollowing the underwhelming performance of their first production, Agni Pariksha (1970), Krishna and his production house, Padmalaya Films, sought to introduce the Western (cowboy) genre to Telugu cinema. This decision was influenced by the popularity of cowboy films being shown in Madras at the time. Krishna later stated that the purpose of the film was to give himself a new image and status. While most films at the time had a budget of around ₹3–4 lakh, Krishna allocated ₹7–8 lakh for this film, doubling the usual budget to ensure its production quality.\nThe film drew inspiration from Western classics such as For a Few Dollars More (1965), The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), and Mackenna's Gold (1969). To adapt this genre for an Indian audience, writer Aarudra was enlisted to develop the story and dialogues. Aarudra set the narrative in the 18th century, during the aftermath of the Battle of Bobbili (1757), a time of political upheaval with British and French forces' involvement in Indian politics. The story was centered around a fictional search for the hidden Amaraveedu treasure. Despite comparisons to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, director K. S. R. Das clarified that Mosagallaku Mosagadu was specifically adapted to suit Telugu nativity, with only one scene inspired by the Italian film. Das also mentioned that he had not seen the film himself.\n\nCasting\nKrishna was so impressed with the story that he insisted Aarudra direct the film. However, when Aarudra declined, Krishna and his brothers chose K. S. R. Das to helm the project. Das had previously directed Rowdy Rani (1970), presenting Vijaya Nirmala in an action role, and Takkaridonga Chakkani Chukka (1969), also starring Krishna and Vijaya Nirmala. This marked Das's first Telugu colour film.\nKrishna starred in the lead role, with Vijaya Nirmala, Nagabhushanam, Jyothi Lakshmi, and Sathyanarayana in pivotal roles. The film also featured Krishna's eldest son, Ramesh, in a childhood role, and his youngest brother, G. Adiseshagiri Rao, in a cameo. Nagabhushanam's character, Nakkajittula Naganna, was based on Eli Wallach's \"Ugly\" from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. But, Nagabhushanam added his own style, giving a lively performance that stood out. The cast underwent training in horse riding and handling firearms, with Vijaya Nirmala recalling the body aches from the riding lessons on Madras's Marina Beach.\n\nFilming\nMosagallaku Mosagadu was shot in colour, a decision that was initially met with skepticism from distributors who preferred black-and-white films due to cost considerations. The production team ultimately decided to proceed with colour filming, despite the increased budget.\nThe film was shot in Eastmancolor, a technical milestone for Telugu cinema. Filming took place in diverse locations, including Bikaner, Shimla, Pondicherry, and Madras. Most of the crew traveled to Rajasthan in a specially booked train, while Krishna, Vijaya Nirmala, Jyothi Kakshmi, and Nagabhushanam flew to the location. Key desert scenes were filmed in the stretch between Bikaner to Jaisalmer. Following the shoot, the crew traveled by car from Bikaner to Shimla.\nKey scenes were shot in Kufri, Narkanda, and Tattapani in Himachal Pradesh during snowfall, as well as in the Thar Desert's sand dunes in Rajasthan. Indoor scenes were filmed at Vauhini Studios. The song \"Korinadi Neraverinadi\" was filmed in Kufri and Narkanda, where Vijaya Nirmala performed barefoot in the snow. The cinematography by V. S. R. Swamy was praised for its innovative use of backlighting, offering Telugu audiences a fresh visual experience.\n\nMake up\nIn one memorable scene, Krishna's character is left stranded in the desert, where his face appears sunburned and blistered. Cinematographer V. S. R. Swamy asked makeup artist Madhava Rao to create the blistered effect. Lacking specialized materials in the desert, Madhava Rao improvised by using pea seeds. He peeled and cut the seeds in half, then glued them to Krishna's face. This simple method created a realistic look for the scene.\n\nSoundtrack\nMusic is composed by P. Adinarayana Rao with lyrics written by Arudra-Appalacharya.\n\nRelease\nAfter the film was completed, a preview in Madras received lukewarm reactions, with many predicting it would fail. Many producers in Madras were skeptical about the extravagance and budget of the film, predicting a bleak future for Padmalaya Studios. However, Mosagallaku Mosagadu was a major success, running for 100 days in multiple theatres, including a record-setting run in Bangalore. The film was completed on a budget of ₹8 lakh, shot in 28 days, and grossed ₹32 lakh upon its initial release. It was also dubbed and released in several languages, including English as Treasure Hunt, Hindi as Gunfighter Johnny, and Tamil as Mosakkaaranukku Mosakkaaran. The Tamil and Hindi versions had a good run at the box office.\nThe film was re-released in 4K on 31 May 2023, coinciding with Krishna's birthday. In the re-release, 19 minutes of the original film were cut, including a couple of songs and a fight sequence.\n\nLegacy\nMosagallaku Mosagadu is considered the first true Western film made in India, though a few dacoit-themed films in Hindi and other languages may have been released before 1971. The film became a trendsetter in Telugu cinema, establishing Krishna as the first Telugu \"cowboy.\" Its innovative use of locations and action sequences played a key role in its success, leading to the rise of the cowboy genre in Telugu cinema.\nFollowing the film's popularity, several other \"Telugu cowboy\" movies were produced, and Krishna signed six similar films soon after. The genre was later picked up in Hindi cinema by actors like Feroz Khan, Mithun Chakraborty, Shatrughan Sinha, and Danny Denzongpa. Krishna's son Mahesh Babu also starred in a cowboy film, Takkari Donga, in 2002.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nMosagallaku Mosagadu at IMDb"

    "synopsis": "Bhale Thammudu (transl. Bravo, younger brother!) is a 1969 Indian Telugu-language action crime film co-written and directed by B. A. Subba Rao. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao and K. R. Vijaya, with music composed by T. V. Raju. It is a remake of the Hindi film China Town (1962).\nThe film focuses on two estranged, separately raised twin brothers, following their father's murder. One brother has become a gangster, the other has become a club singer. An inspector convinces the singer to impersonate his brother and to infiltrate the gang.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with Inspector Prasad sentencing deadly gangsters of a dangerous gang, and their chief, Ganapathi / Gun, wants to take revenge against him, so he kills him and also kidnaps one of his twin sons, Ram Prasad. Ram grows up among the gangsters by the name of Paul and becomes a daredevil gangster. Once, the police lay hold of Paul in a robbery. Inspector Sekhar hides him secretly and tries to reveal the truth, which he refuses, even after a lot of torture.\nShaam Prasad, the younger one, brought up by his mother, is a club singer who loves Geetha, Rao Saheb's daughter. Rao Saheb learns about their love affair, so he takes his daughter to Hyderabad, and Shaam also follows. One night, Shaam enters Geetha's house, and Rao Saheb has him arrested. Inspector Shekar observes the resemblance between Paul and Shaam, offers him the C.I.D. job, and decides to send him into their gang as Paul. Shaam tells his mother about Paul when she recognizes him as her elder son Ram Prasad and meets him, but Paul rejects her.\nNow Shaam gets ready to take up the job, and like Paul, he safely lands in the gang. Everyone in the gang believes him except Paul's lover, Leela, who doubts his character and discovers the truth. Then Shaam reveals the entire story and seeks her help, and she agrees. Listening to it, Gun captures Shaam. Meanwhile, Paul's health deteriorates; while shifting to the hospital, the ambulance meets with an accident. Geeta saves him, thinking like Shaam, and Paul takes her to the den when he finds out about Shaam's cheating. He starts beating him in that anger when Leela obstructs his way and reveals reality. Here, Paul repents his behavior, and Shaam consoles him. At last, both the brothers are united and see the end of Gun and his gang. Ram / Paul also surrenders and is sentenced to six months. Finally, Ram is released, Shaam becomes a police officer, and the movie ends on a happy note with the marriages of Ram and Leela and Shaam and Geetha.\n\nCast\nN. T. Rama Rao as Ram Prasad (Paul) and Shyam Prasad\nK. R. Vijaya as Geetha\nRelangi as Rao Saheb\nRajanala as Gun / Ganapathi\nM. Prabhakar Reddy as Inspector Sekhar\nMikkilineni as Inspector Prasad\nDr. Sivaramakrishnaiah\nSriranjani Jr.\nVijaya Girija as Leela\nRamaprabha\nAruna Irani as an item number\n\nSoundtrack\nThe music was composed by T. V. Raju with lyrics written by C. Narayana Reddy. The song \"Nede Eenade\" was remixed by Mani Sharma for Allari Pidugu. The song \"Enthavaru Gaani\" was later remixed by Sunny M.

Rama Rao and Jamuna with Master Rajkumar in the title role reprising his role from the Tamil film. The film's music  was composed by R. Govardhanam. It is a remake of the Tamil film of the same name (1966), which was based on the Hindi film Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein (1964) which was not successful. However, this telugu film was a silver jubilee hit.\n\nPlot\nRamu is an active boy who lives happily with his father, Raja, and mother, Seeta. One day, Raja, who works as a soldier, receives an emergency call and rushes to the battlefield. While he is gone, dacoits attack their village and set fire to Ramu's house, burning Seeta alive. The sight causes Ramu to lose his voice. Afterward, their neighbor Chinnayya takes care of Ramu and waits for Raja's arrival. Learning the facts, Raja returns and is shocked. He takes an oath to get his son's voice back, and they leave the village.\nParallelly, in another village, Lakshmi, daughter of Sipayi Singanna, is a wealthy woman whose property is under the guardianship of her maternal uncle Ganganna. Ganganna has two sons: Ranganna, who is as crooked as his father, and Venkanna, who is kind-hearted. Ganganna wants to grab Lakshmi's property by performing her marriage with Ranganna. But Lakshmi gets back her property through the court. Due to this, Ganganna develops a grudge against her.\nOn their way back, Ramu and Raja pass through the village, where Ranganna beats Ramu for obstructing. A fight arises between Ranganna and Raja. Ranganna strikes Raja, and he faints. Lakshmi spots them, takes them along with her, and requests that Raja stay in her house until he recovers. Days pass, and Ramu gets closer to Lakshmi; she also cares for him as her son and loves Raja.\nMeanwhile, Ganganna ensures no one works in Lakshmi's fields, but Raja comes forward and completes the farming. Eventually, Ramu visits a burial ground where he meets a madman, Gopalam, whose daughter has been cheated on by Ganganna. Both Gopalam and Ramu become good friends. Frustrated, Ranganna kidnaps Ramu and keeps him in his custody. Lakshmi, in search of Ramu, reaches there when Ranganna tries to molest her. Venkanna informs Raja, and he, too, arrives there. In the fight between Raja and Ranganna, fire erupts, and Lakshmi is stuck. Due to this incident, Ramu gets back his voice and saves her. Gopalam recognizes Ganganna, kills him, and surrenders. The film ends with the marriage of Raja & Lakshmi.\n\nCast\n\nMusic\nMusic was composed by R. Govardhanam.\n\nRelease and reception\nRamu was released on 4 May 1968.

    "synopsis": "Bhama Vijayam (transl. Young Lady's Victory) is a 1967 Indian Telugu-language swashbuckler film, produced by Somasekhar and Radha Krishna, and directed by C.Pulliah. It stars N. T. Rama Rao and Devika, with music composed by T. V. Raju. The film is based on Gollabhama (1947) which itself is based on the stories of Kaasi Majililu written in Telugu by Madhira Subbanna Deekshitulu.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with Kamavardhana, Kalinga's king, attempting to molest tribal girl Sundari. Jayachandra, a prince,  secures and falls for her. But perceiving her animosity toward kingship, he introduces himself as a soldier, safehouses her, carves her as a wise lady and knits her with the consent of his parents. The couple leads a delightful life until an abyss arises as an angel, Vahini, infatuated with Jayachandra, abducts him to heaven and entices him, but to avail. On earth, Sundari woes for adversity. Jayachandra consents to Vahini and calls Sundari to heaven. Here, the pair unintentionally takes the nectar Amrutham and becomes immortal. The next day, she backs and conceives when not a soul trusts her consummation with Jayachandra, and the king edicts capital punishment. Yet, by deathlessness, the guards fail to execute it and return, departing Sundari in the forest. Whereat, she gives birth to a baby boy, Balarka, who has the power to listen to the voices of all creatures. Tragically, he gets misplaced, shielded by Kali, who boons him to King Udayarka. Sundari lands at a cathouse and faces the music but secures her chastity. Years roll by, and Jayachandra frees from the clutches of Vahini, restoring and divulging the actuality. Now, he proceeds for Sundari, who did not lose her magnificence. She is acquainted with her son Balarka and recognizes him. The same night, he gets to know her when he hears a conversation between a cow & calf that a man in lust cannot identify the relationship. Then, Sundari cannot face him, so she jumps into the fire, but Jayachandra safeguards her. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the family's reunion.\n\nCast\nN. T.

It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Krishna Kumari, with music composed by S. Rajeswara Rao. The film is based on the Sanskrit Stage drama, Mṛcchakatika by Śūdraka of 5th century AD. It was Padmini's last Telugu movie.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins around 2000 years ago at Ujjain, Chaaru Datta, a renowned artist & rectitude, despite impoverishing his wife, Aditi & son Rohasena. Vasantha Sena is an expert dancer & musician who protects her purity, though she was born into a courtesan family. Both are acquainted and enamored, and they write a romance poem. Parallelly, Ujjain ruler Palaka marks his lecherous brother-in-law Samsthanaka as his representative. Samsthanaka keeps an evil eye on Vasantha Sena and aspires to possess her, but she refuses. Eventually, anarchy arises in the kingdom due to the waywardness of King Palaka, and warrior Aryaka plots a revolution. Once, Vasantha Sena entrusts her jewelry to Charu Datta for a future meeting, which a thief Sarvilaka steals to relieve his lover Madanika, the maid of Vasantha Sena, from imprisonment. Despite recognizing it, Vasantha Sena sets Madanika free. Here, Charu Datta presents a rare pearl necklace to Vasantha Sena, which belongs to Aditi and is more valuable than stolen jewelry. Knowing it, Aditi leaves the house when Charu Datta's friend Maitreya warns him that his deeds may lead to catastrophic situations, but he Keeps a deaf ear. Charu Datta now accepts Vasantha Sena as his mistress and promises to send her a chariot. At that juncture, Samsthanaka ploys and misleads Vasantha Sena by sending his chariot, where he tries to molest her. In that scramble, Samsthanaka assumes Vasantha Sena died when he incriminates Chaaru Datta, who has to pay the death penalty. Just before, Vasantha Sena revives and saves Charu Datta when Aditi realizes her virtue and accepts her. Simultaneously, Aryaka dethrones Palaka by forming a new state and arrests Samsthanaka.

    "synopsis": "Rahasyam (transl. Secret) is a 1967 Indian Telugu-language swashbuckler film directed by Vedantam Raghavayya. It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, B. Saroja Devi, Kanta Rao, Krishna Kumari and S. V. Ranga Rao, with music composed by Ghantasala. The film was produced by Allareddy Shankar Reddy under the Lalitha Siva Jyothi Films banner.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with Saint Rakthabhisha & Sriganda, king of Kanchipuram, as disciples of Narada. The two develop a rivalry, feeling superior to the other. Rakthabhisha is a great devotee of Goddess Lalitha; he contracts an underground temple and performs penance and boons for salvation. The goddess proclaims he acquires only after the marital life and blessing with a son. Then she bestows him a ring as a lock to the temple, which is inaccessible even to him without it. After that, Rakthabhisha lands Chandrapuri with his acolyte Krishna, a freak. Mandaka, a gallant, the son of Nityananda, a colleague of Rakthabhisha, visits for his blessings. Parallelly, Karunakara, the king of Chandrapuri, arrives with his blind daughter Rajyalakshmi & lame niece Kumari. Sriganda also reaches therein and challenges Rakthabhisha to create heaven, and he does so by transforming Mandaka into Indra, Rajyalakshmi & Kumari into Apsara. Forthwith, Sriganda disappears, but he cannot remove the woman's beauty. Here, Sriganda is attracted to Rajyalakshmi and attempts to abduct her when Prince Ravi Chandra secures her with Mandaka. Karunakara gives hospitality to two and adopts Mandaka. Plus, Ravi Chandra & Mandaka turn into besties. Meanwhile, Mandaka & Kumari, Ravi Chandra & Rajyalakshmi crush. \nEventually, Sriganda sends the proposal to knit Rajyalakshmi when Mandaka, with wit, performs the nuptial of Ravi Chandra & Rajyalakshmi. Chandramma, the sister of Karunakara, quits to Kanchipuram with her daughter Kumari, intending to wedlock her with Sriganda. Mandaka gets here in disguise and continues his love affair with Kumari. After a while, Rajyalakshmi conceives, and Ravi Chandra proceeds to his hometown. Consequently, Sriganda conquers Chandrapuri and captures Karunakara, but Rajyalakshmi escapes. Being conscious of it, Mandaka attempts to free Karunakara and is chased by the soldiers. Besides, Rakthabhisha loses the ring that Mandaka obtains and enters the secret temple. Eventually, he makes Krishna normal, via whom Mandaka is startled to know that Ravi Chandra is the transformation of Rakthabhisha to attain his salvation. As of today, Mandaka affirms that this injustice should not be allowed. Parallelly, they detect Rajyalakshmi, who gives birth to a baby boy, and Mandaka goes on for Rakthabhisha, leaving the two under Krishna's guardianship. Here, Mandaka acquires the boon for the goddess by installing the ring at the feet and constantly shifts Rakthabhisha into Ravi Chandra. Eventually, Sriganda plans to crown his lieutenant Virupaksha as king of Chandrapuri and splice with Kumari. Amid, they find Rajyalakshmi and seize her. Krishna reveals it to Mandaka & Ravi Chandra, and there are two strikes where Sriganda is defeated and loses his powers. At last, Karunakara is re-crowned, and Rajyalakshmi is united with Ravi Chandra. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Mandaka & Kumari.\n\nCast\nSource\n\nMusic\n\nMusic was composed by Ghantasala.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nRahasyam at IMDb"

Rama Rao, Anjali Devi, Kanta Rao and Jamuna with music composed by Pendyala Nageswara Rao.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with Krishna & Satyabhama returning to Dwaraka after defeating Narakasura. Hereupon, Satyabhama is deluded that herself as the victory's leading cause. Meanwhile, Narada obtains a Parijata flower from heaven, bestows it on Krishna, and requests the honor for Krishna's prime consort, and Krishna endorses it to Rukmini. This infuriates Satyabhama, making her annoyed toward Krishna. Ergo, he oaths her to accord the entire Parijat tree and plant it in her garden. Next, Krishna lands in heaven, confronts Indra, wins the tree, and gifts it to Satyabhama.\nConsequently, her pride magnifies tenfold, and she looks at Rukmini at a low pace. Following, on Rukmini's birthday, she invites Krishna for hospitality, which Satyabhama denies. Anyhow, the Lord surrenders for Rukmini's devotion. Thus, Satyabhama aims to hold proprietorial power over him and possess all his love. Hence, to enlighten her, Narada derives a game to perform a ritual called Sri Krishna Tulabharam, i.e., to donate her husband with the Parijat tree and recoup him by weighing him with  equivalent wealth. \nHere, the deluded divine consort Satyabhama fails leading to Narada purportedly carrying Krishna and auctioning him in the streets. At this, the public revolts, and all the fellow wives plead with Narada to acquit Krishna in lieu of their possessions. Then, he proclaims that the Lord grants only devotion, and the one & only who does so in the universe is Rukmini. Accordingly, Satyabhama bows her head down before Rukmini, who retrieves Krishna with Tulasidalam, the Basil leaf. Finally, the movie ends with Satyabhama perceiving the Lord's form and being freed from delusion.\n\nCast\nN. T.

    "synopsis": "Zamindar (transl. Landlord) is a 1966 Indian Telugu-language action thriller film directed by V. Madhusudhana Rao. It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao,  Krishna Kumari and music composed by T. Chalapathi Rao. It was produced by Tammareddy Krishna Murthy under the Ravindra Art Pictures banner. The film is loosely based on the 1963  English film Charade.\n\nPlot\nDuring the World War II 6 soldiers Narahari, Raja Rao /Raju, Jogindar, Johnny, Murthy & Kumar were tasked to take ₹2,500,000 (US$30,000) (25 lakhs) from one camp to another. Halfway there, they all hatch a plan to steal it. So, they hide it and tell that the enemies have looted the money. After the battle, Joginder is initially dismissed from service and entrusted with guarding the treasure. Then, the rest of the people go home when the constabulary arrests Joginder at the Calcutta railway station. Amidst the turmoil, Narahari picks up Joginder's briefcase. \nYears have passed, and Narahari enjoys social prestige and lives with his wife, Madam, & daughter, Saroja. There, Seshagiri Rao / Seshu is a loaf radio mechanic nicknamed Zamindar. He adores his elder brother Subba Rao, Narahari's clerk and sister-in-law Lakshmi like his parents. To thwart Seshu's vagrancy, his brother locks him up at home, but daily he absconds with his sister-in-law's aid. Seshu conducts paranormal activities and cryptic conversations via radio communications. Once, Seshu acquaints Saroja in a squabble, who misinterprets him as real Zamindar by his pet name, and they fall in love. Next, Saroja's maternal uncle Hanumanthu, an amateur detective, considers it a fact and introduces Seshu as Zamindar to family members. Though Saroja knows the truth, she asks Seshu to be quiet until their marriage.\nMeanwhile, Raju's arrival terrifies Narahari, who torments him for the money. He implores that it is unbeknownst to him displaying Jogindra's box, which holds nothing except some clothes & a pocket watch. Ergo, Raju menacingly grabs half of his property. Plus, he learns that Seshu is not a Zamindar and hires his henchmen to stage an act which makes Subba Rao reveal Seshu as his brother. Enraged at the betrayal and assuming Subba Rao to be involved in Seshu's act, Narahari slaps him. Seshu enrages and threatens to kill him. Exploiting it, Raju kills Narahari. He uses the same henchmen to stage another act and lead Seshu to Narahari's house and implicate Seshu in the murder. Immediately, Seshu chases after them. Subba Rao sees Seshu leaving through the window and misjudging the context, Subba Rao self-incriminates to shield Seshu. Saroja also sees Seshu running, and thinks he is the murderer.\nFrom there, Seshu gets hatred of all but stands firm. Due to the absence of evidence, Subba Rao is acquitted when Raju seizes him along with Lakshmi. Parallelly, Johnny, Murthy & Kumar storm Narahari's residence, house arrest the family, and search for the loot. Joginder's briefcase is found but they do not find the money. Here, Raju changes the backstory and pretends to be good before Narahari's family by lying that he is a CID officer who arrived to solve the case and locate the stolen fortune. Seshu constantly monitors & surveillance their movements. The three men continue to torment Narahari's family. One night, Seshu comes to Saroja's house in search of Narahari's diaries to find the loot, but Saroja objects and demands that he leave. On his way out, he tangles with Murthy and fends him off. When Kumar violently approaches Saroja, Seshu breaks in and threatens him, after which he leaves. Seshu then fights Johnny and incapacitates him. Saroja walks into the bathroom to find Kumar lying dead in the tub.\nRaju and Saroja find Narahari's diaries and find out where the loot must be kept. Raju goes to the location, meanwhile Johnny overhears Saroja mention the location. Johnny arrives at the spot, where Raju tricks him and kills him. At that time, Joginder appears and states that he exchanged the money for diamonds and hoarded them in the pocket watch. Murthy tries to run for the loot but is killed by Joginder. Joginder finds Hanumanthu with a pocket watch and takes it. Seshu combats Joginder and kills him, taking the watch, only to realize that is a new watch that Hanumanthu bought after selling the old one at a watch shop. Saroja and Hanumanthu arrive at the watch shop and secure the old watch with the diamonds. Saroja runs with the watch and Seshu pursues her. In the middle of the forest, Raju confronts Seshu and demands the watch be given to him or else he will kill both of them. Raju reveals himself as the killer of Narahari and mastermind criminal behind everything, shocking Saroja. He holds Saroja captive while Seshu surrenders. But Seshu comes from behind, and in a final battle, kills Raju and secures the watch.\nAt last, as a flabbergast, Seshu turns to be a CID officer assigned to solve the case for the past 6 months. Finally, the movie ends happily with the marriage of Seshu & Saroja.\n\nCast\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao as Seshagiri Rao \"Seshu\"\nKrishna Kumari as Saroja\nGummadi as Subbarao\nNagabhushanam as Raja Rao \"Raju\"\nRelangi as Hanumanthu\nMudigonda Lingamurthy as Narahari\nMikkilineni as Joginder\nSatyanarayana as Johnny\nNellore Kanta Rao as Murthy\nCh.

In the song Addala Meda Vundi, heavy star cast Jayalalitha, Kanchana, Jamuna and Girija make guest appearances as patients admitted in mental hospital.\n\nPlot\nThe plot of the movie is based on what happens during Navaratri (\"nine nights\"). The film opens with the narrator explaining that there are nine types of human behaviors (Navarasam), such as Wonder, Fear, Compassion,  Anger, Equanimity, Disgust, Elegance, Bravery and Bliss and that Nageswara Rao's nine roles represents one character per role.\nRadha (Savitri) is the only daughter of a rich man. When she happily celebrates Navaratri festival at her home with her friends, her father informs her about the visit of a  groom and his parents for her wedding. Radha is reluctant to the proposal as she wants to marry her college mate Venu Gopal. After arguments with her father, she leaves home without her father's knowledge at the first Navaratri night.\nFirst Night (Wonder): She searches for her lover in the college hostel, but finds that he has gone to get married. Radha feels cheated by Venu and attempts suicide, where she is stopped by a widower Anand (Akkineni Nageswara Rao). He takes her to his house and introduces her to his daughter. He urges her to tell her address to drop her safely. Unwilling to return home, she leaves the place the next early morning.\nSecond Night (Fear): The next day she damages the pot of a vendor by mistake. When vendor fights with her she was rescued by a homely looking woman. The woman takes Radha to her home. Radha meets several women in her house. But the house is actually a brothel. She is trapped by a drunkard (Akkineni Nageswara Rao). The drunkard justifies this, that he cannot seduce his own wife as she is a T.B. patient. Though he does not want to betray his wife, he is not able to resist his feelings. Radha advises and warns him in order to escape from him, but he does not want to hear it. After much struggle, the drunkard falls on the floor and faints. Radha escapes from the place.\nThird night (Compassion): After escaping from the brothel, Radha is caught by a patrol policeman for wandering into the road at an unusual time. At the police station she pretends to be a mentally ill woman. The police admit her to a mental hospital. The old aged lonely doctor Karunakar (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) understands that Radha is fine, but is pretending to be ill to escape from the cops and so he helps her. She stays in the hospital the whole night. Meanwhile, Radha's father comes, in search of her, to the Doctor. The Doctor eventually understands the situation and asks one of the nurses to call Radha. But Radha has escaped.\nFourth Night (Anger): Radha misunderstands that the police jeep is coming for her. She dashes with a man with a gun (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) and faints. The man takes her to his place. Radha understands police is not looking for her but looking for the man as he is a killer who killed a rich businessman in revenge for his brother's death. The gunman insists that Radha should leave. But she doesn't as she feels he is a good person and convinces him to surrender to police. In an attack, the gunman is killed by the businessman's henchmen. Radha escapes from the place.\nFifth night (Equanimity): Radha runs into a farmer group cheering and dancing while harvesting the crop. An innocent villager (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), takes her to his house and introduces to his elder sister. A local priest (Relangi) visits their home and says that Radha is possessed by a spirit in order to cheat her of money by performing some fake rituals. Radha gets irritated by their acts and escapes away that night.\nSixth Night (Disgust): Radha meets an old aged leper (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), who once upon a time was a rich man. The man lost all his money in the treatment and charity (hoping that it would help him from the disease). He is disgusted by everyone including his own son who discarded him when his money ran out. Radha helps him by taking him to a hospital. The doctor is surprised as he is one who has benefited with a medicine degree by the charity of the rich man. The doctor decides to stay with him until he is cured. Radha leaves the hospital.\nSeventh Night (Elegance): Radha feels very tired and asks for water from one of the houses. People offer water for her. One of the men \"Bhagavatha Rao\" (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), is a director and actor of stage plays and road side plays. They have been committed for nine stage plays in the village on the account of Navaratri celebration. But the heroine elopes with a harmonium player and his whole troop are in critical position in search of a replacement for the seventh day play failing on which will make them to lose their money and reputation in the village.

The agent tries to misbehave with Radha and the actor pulls him away and warns him. But he finds that Radha has left.\nEighth Night (Bravery): Radha disguises herself as a man and visits the house of a hunter (Akkineni Nageswara Rao). The hunter has been there for hunting a tiger and for another purpose. Radha introduces herself a secret agent in search of a criminal. The hunter seems to believe her and gives her an earnest welcome, feast and hospitality. Radha finds that the hunter is actually a commissioner of police staying in search of a criminal, which is actually faked by Radha. She tries to escape from the place, but she is caught by the hunter.\nThe hunter introduces himself as the paternal uncle of the groom whom her father proposed for her and the groom is none other than her lover -  Venu Gopal (Akkineni Nageswara Rao). Radha has actually left her home before her father knew that she was in love with a person and the lover is the same man he has arranged for his daughter. Also Radha misunderstands that Venu Gopal actually is going to marry another girl but the girl is actually herself. Radha leaves for Venu Gopal's place the ninth day.\nNinth Day (Bliss): Venu Gopal (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), looks pale and dull after Radha left her home. He is neither interested in living, nor in continuing with his studies. His parents are worried and scold him for wasting his life for a girl after all. Angered by this, he shuts himself into a room. Radha reaches his home that time. Venu's parents and Radha fear that he is attempting suicide. But suddenly the room opens and Radha runs inside.\nVenu Gopal actually wanted to surprise Radha about their marriage and that is why he did not inform her about the engagement. Due to miscommunication, Radha left home on the first Navaratri Night and comes back on ninth Navaratri night.\nVenu Gopal and Radha happily marry. Except the dead gunman named Gopal Rao of the fourth night, her marriage is attended by the all the seven characters (portrayed by Akkineni Nageswara Rao) she met during those eight days.\n\nCast\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMusic composed by T.

    "synopsis": "Aada Brathuku  (transl. Women's Life) is a 1965 Indian Telugu-language drama film, produced by S. S. Vasan of Gemini Studios and directed by Vedantam Raghavayya. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Kantha Rao and Devika (her first appearance in a Telugu Gemini production), with the music composed by the duo Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy (M. S. Viswanathan and T. K. Ramamoorthy). The duo parted ways later, making this their last joint appearance in a Telugu film. The film is a remake of the studio's own Hindi film Zindagi (1964).\n\nPlot\nSita, an unemployed benevolent, resides with his mother, Shantamma. She partakes in a theatrical tribe for livelihood owned by the true Gopal Rao. The two form a close bond, and he silently endears her. Once, the spiteful playhouse proprietor Ganga Raju lusts and attempts to abduct Sita. Raja, the son of a Zamindar, Rao Bahadur Ranganatham, shields her and they fall in love. However, since Rao Bahadur adheres to ancestry, he misjudges Sita's profession and intimacy with Gopal Rao. So, he endeavors to exile Sita from his son's life via plea, threat & wealth, but she stamps on her self-esteem. Raja elects Sita and is about to let out. Then, Rao Bahadur relents and approves the match, ensuring Sita never again sees Gopal Rao. Presently, the grand nuptial of Raja & Sita is happening. Gopal Rao also attends it, comprehends the status quo, and promises Sita to move accordingly. Raja & Sita lead an intimate & affectionate life, and she conceives.\nMeanwhile, in animosity, Ganga Raju cheap a voice about Sita, to which Gopal Rao revolts and threatens to slay him. Once, Sita got stuck in the dreaded curfew, where Gopal Rao bracketed her, and she silently walked the next day. The same night, Ganga Raju shoots out with Jogulu, who butchers him and incriminates Gopal Rao. He alleged an alibi at the judiciary but hid her identity. Sita abides by righteousness, bears witness, and acquits Gopal Rao. Ergo, Rao Bahadur ostracizes her, denouncing the purity which Raja also adjudges. Sita quits the town along with Shantamma on the ordinance of her father-in-law.\nDestiny makes her crack up in front of kind-hearted Sher Khan’s house, a boon fellow of Rao Bahadur. Right now, he shelters them where Sita delivers a baby boy. Devastated, Raja meets with an accident as a rover whom Sita fortuitously secures. With an allegiance, she recoups her husband under a veil. Raja gets closer to the boy, unbeknownst to actuality and so dear to him. Conscious of the mishap, Rao Bahadur arrives and implores his son when Raja agrees to remarry for his comfort. In the nick of time, Gopal Rao lands evidence of the Sita's eminence. Sher Khan also glorifies her for getting the facts. Thus, Raja hurries toward Sita when a catastrophic earthquake knocks them, but both are safe. At last, Rao Bahadur seeks pardon from Sita & Gopal Rao. Finally, the movie happily ends with the couple's reunion.\n\nCast\nN. T. Rama Rao as Raja\nDevika as Seeta\nS. V.

It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Savitri, with music composed by K. V. Mahadevan. The film is a remake of the Tamil film Sarada (1962).\n\nPlot\nProf. Viswam lives with his mother, Visalakshamma & sister, Uma. He got a post in a renowned college owned by Srihari Rao. His daughter Sarada is a student of Viswam who admires his ideologies, and they fall in love. Srihari Rao opposes it since he fixes Sarada's alliance with his nephew Shekar. She knits Viswam against her father's wish, making Shekar quit and become a wanderer as he has endeared Sarada since childhood. Soon, Viswam reaches his hometown and picks up a new job, and when the couple dreams about a happy married life, things get shattered. Viswam meets with an accident in which he becomes impotent. Now, Sarada's life is subliminal, but she stands up with courage and protects her husband with celibacy. Parallelly, Shekar lands where he is acquainted with Viswam being unbeknownst. Distressed, Viswam is not able to tolerate the torture faced by Sarada, so he attempts suicide when Shekar rescues him and gives him a piece of advice to remarriage his wife. At that moment, Viswam relaxed, accepted his mother, and became aware of Shekar & Sarada's relationship. Hence, he convinces him too, which devoted Sarada denies when Viswam compels her. During the time of the wedding, Sarada takes poison, declaring the Indian women's devotion to nuptials.

    "synopsis": "Zamindar (transl. Landlord) is a 1966 Indian Telugu-language action thriller film directed by V. Madhusudhana Rao. It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao,  Krishna Kumari and music composed by T. Chalapathi Rao. It was produced by Tammareddy Krishna Murthy under the Ravindra Art Pictures banner. The film is loosely based on the 1963  English film Charade.\n\nPlot\nDuring the World War II 6 soldiers Narahari, Raja Rao /Raju, Jogindar, Johnny, Murthy & Kumar were tasked to take ₹2,500,000 (US$30,000) (25 lakhs) from one camp to another. Halfway there, they all hatch a plan to steal it. So, they hide it and tell that the enemies have looted the money. After the battle, Joginder is initially dismissed from service and entrusted with guarding the treasure. Then, the rest of the people go home when the constabulary arrests Joginder at the Calcutta railway station. Amidst the turmoil, Narahari picks up Joginder's briefcase. \nYears have passed, and Narahari enjoys social prestige and lives with his wife, Madam, & daughter, Saroja. There, Seshagiri Rao / Seshu is a loaf radio mechanic nicknamed Zamindar. He adores his elder brother Subba Rao, Narahari's clerk and sister-in-law Lakshmi like his parents. To thwart Seshu's vagrancy, his brother locks him up at home, but daily he absconds with his sister-in-law's aid. Seshu conducts paranormal activities and cryptic conversations via radio communications. Once, Seshu acquaints Saroja in a squabble, who misinterprets him as real Zamindar by his pet name, and they fall in love. Next, Saroja's maternal uncle Hanumanthu, an amateur detective, considers it a fact and introduces Seshu as Zamindar to family members. Though Saroja knows the truth, she asks Seshu to be quiet until their marriage.\nMeanwhile, Raju's arrival terrifies Narahari, who torments him for the money. He implores that it is unbeknownst to him displaying Jogindra's box, which holds nothing except some clothes & a pocket watch. Ergo, Raju menacingly grabs half of his property. Plus, he learns that Seshu is not a Zamindar and hires his henchmen to stage an act which makes Subba Rao reveal Seshu as his brother. Enraged at the betrayal and assuming Subba Rao to be involved in Seshu's act, Narahari slaps him. Seshu enrages and threatens to kill him. Exploiting it, Raju kills Narahari. He uses the same henchmen to stage another act and lead Seshu to Narahari's house and implicate Seshu in the murder. Immediately, Seshu chases after them. Subba Rao sees Seshu leaving through the window and misjudging the context, Subba Rao self-incriminates to shield Seshu. Saroja also sees Seshu running, and thinks he is the murderer.\nFrom there, Seshu gets hatred of all but stands firm. Due to the absence of evidence, Subba Rao is acquitted when Raju seizes him along with Lakshmi. Parallelly, Johnny, Murthy & Kumar storm Narahari's residence, house arrest the family, and search for the loot. Joginder's briefcase is found but they do not find the money. Here, Raju changes the backstory and pretends to be good before Narahari's family by lying that he is a CID officer who arrived to solve the case and locate the stolen fortune. Seshu constantly monitors & surveillance their movements. The three men continue to torment Narahari's family. One night, Seshu comes to Saroja's house in search of Narahari's diaries to find the loot, but Saroja objects and demands that he leave. On his way out, he tangles with Murthy and fends him off. When Kumar violently approaches Saroja, Seshu breaks in and threatens him, after which he leaves. Seshu then fights Johnny and incapacitates him. Saroja walks into the bathroom to find Kumar lying dead in the tub.\nRaju and Saroja find Narahari's diaries and find out where the loot must be kept. Raju goes to the location, meanwhile Johnny overhears Saroja mention the location. Johnny arrives at the spot, where Raju tricks him and kills him. At that time, Joginder appears and states that he exchanged the money for diamonds and hoarded them in the pocket watch. Murthy tries to run for the loot but is killed by Joginder. Joginder finds Hanumanthu with a pocket watch and takes it. Seshu combats Joginder and kills him, taking the watch, only to realize that is a new watch that Hanumanthu bought after selling the old one at a watch shop. Saroja and Hanumanthu arrive at the watch shop and secure the old watch with the diamonds. Saroja runs with the watch and Seshu pursues her. In the middle of the forest, Raju confronts Seshu and demands the watch be given to him or else he will kill both of them. Raju reveals himself as the killer of Narahari and mastermind criminal behind everything, shocking Saroja. He holds Saroja captive while Seshu surrenders. But Seshu comes from behind, and in a final battle, kills Raju and secures the watch.\nAt last, as a flabbergast, Seshu turns to be a CID officer assigned to solve the case for the past 6 months. Finally, the movie ends happily with the marriage of Seshu & Saroja.\n\nCast\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao as Seshagiri Rao \"Seshu\"\nKrishna Kumari as Saroja\nGummadi as Subbarao\nNagabhushanam as Raja Rao \"Raju\"\nRelangi as Hanumanthu\nMudigonda Lingamurthy as Narahari\nMikkilineni as Joginder\nSatyanarayana as Johnny\nNellore Kanta Rao as Murthy\nCh.

    "synopsis": "Thene Manasulu (transl. Sweet hearts) is a 1965 Indian Telugu-language romance film directed by Adurthi Subba Rao and produced by C. Sundaram under the Babu Movies banner. The film stars Krishna, Ram Mohan, Sukanya, and Sandhya Rani in lead roles. Notably, it was the first Telugu social film to be shot entirely in colour. The story was based on the novel Vakrinchina Saralarekhalu by K. R. K. Mohan.\nThe film marked the debut of Krishna in a lead role and also the acting debut for Ram Mohan, Sandhya Rani and Sukanya. Despite initial skepticism from some in the industry about casting newcomers, Tene Manasulu became a commercial success and ran for 100 days in theatres. The film is also known for its popular soundtrack composed by K. V. Mahadevan, with songs like \"Divinundi Bhuviki\" and \"Yemamma Ninnenamma\" becoming hits. It was remade in Hindi as Doli (1969).\n\nPlot\nThe story revolves around the intertwined lives of four main characters: Sita, Bhanumathi, Chittibabu, and Basavaraju. Sita is the daughter of Narasaraju, and Bhanumathi is the daughter of Srinivasa Rao. Chittibabu agrees to marry Sita on the condition that her father sends him to the United States for higher studies. However, after Chittibabu leaves, Srinivasa Rao's office money is stolen by Narasaraju, and he flees, leaving Bhanumathi behind.\nBasavaraju, who was originally supposed to marry Bhanumathi, rejects her without even seeing her. Bhanumathi moves to the city with her mother and starts working, unaware that Basavaraju falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Chittibabu returns from the U.S. and neglects Sita, instead falling for Bhanumathi. Bhanumathi, realizing the situation, enacts a drama to reunite Chittibabu and Sita. In the end, she marries Basavaraju, and the film concludes with both couples finding happiness.\n\nCast\nSource: \n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\nIn the mid-1960s, director Adurthi Subba Rao wanted to make a film with newcomers as the stars. It was decided to adapt K. R. K. Mohan's novel Vakrinchina Sarala Rekhalu with the title Thene Manasulu. The film was produced by C. Sundaram under Babu Movies, Mullapudi Venkata Ramana was hired as the screenwriter and K. Viswanath as associate director. Viswanath also worked as the dialogue writer alongside Aatreya. Cinematography was handled by P. S. Selvaraj, and editing by T. Krishna.\n\nCasting\nBabu Movies released an advertisement saying the film required newcomers in the lead, and thousands of aspiring actors auditioned. Hema Malini and J. Jayalalithaa, not yet the stars of Hindi and Tamil cinema they would later become, were among those who auditioned, but both were rejected. Krishnam Raju too was an unsuccessful contender.\nKrishna and Rammohan were selected from thousands of applicants to play the two male leads. Sukanya and Sandhyarani, hailing from Rajahmundry and Vijayawada respectively, were cast as the female leads. This was Krishna's first film in a major role, after he appeared as an extra in the 1962 releases Padandi Munduku and Kula Gotralu. Krishna's remuneration for the film was ₹2,000.\n\nFilming\nAdurthi Subba Rao, known for directing films with established stars, took on the challenge of working with newcomers. The actors were rigorously trained in dialogue delivery by K. Viswanath, while Hiralal coached them in dance sequences. Voice training sessions were held on the beach to help the cast project their voices more effectively.\nPrincipal photography began at Sarathi Studios, Hyderabad. The film was initially planned to be in black-and-white, but after seven to eight reels were shot, Adurthi decided to reshoot the entire film in Eastmancolor. Thene Manasulu thus became the first Telugu social film to be shot completely in colour. A few scenes required Krishna to ride a scooter, so actor Raavi Kondala Rao, at Adurthi’s request, taught Krishna to drive the scooter in the streets leading from Sarathi Studios to Sanathnagar. It took four days for Krishna to learn scooter driving. Thene Manasulu (1965) showcased Krishna's willingness to perform risky stunts. In one scene, he impressed the crew by jumping from a moving scooter onto a speeding jeep without using a double, a feat that left the director Adurthi Subba Rao amazed.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack was composed by K. V. Mahadevan, while the lyrics were written by Aatreya and Dasaradhi.\n\nRelease and reception\nThene Manasulu was released on 31 March 1965.  The film became a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres. Critics praised the film for its fresh cast and technical achievements, particularly the cinematography and music.\n\nLegacy\nAdurthi Subba Rao remade the film in Hindi as Doli (1969) which was also successful. Subba Rao signed the four lead actors again for his next film, Kanne Manasulu (1966) which turned out to be an average grosser. Despite Thene Manasulu's success, only Krishna became a star among the four leads.\nAfter the film, Krishna caught the attention of producers Doondi and Sundarlal Nahata, who were impressed by his daring stunt of jumping onto a speeding car without a double. Recognizing his potential, they cast him in the spy thriller Gudachari 116 (1966), which became a major success and a turning point in Krishna's career.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\nRajadhyaksha, Ashish; Willemen, Paul (1998) .

Tragically, the train traveling meets with a disastrous accident. Knowing it, Prasad rushes to the railway hospital, where he detects unconscious Sita between victims lying in heaps and shifts her home.

Afterward, Lalitha also comprehends the situation when Prasad requests her whereabouts. Indeed, Lalitha is needy and brought up under the scorn of her maternal uncle & aunt. An affluent guy, Ramesh, endeared her but refused to knit for the dowry, and the elders compelled her to wed a wealthy drunkard. So, Lalitha attempted suicide by falling under the same train on which Sita was moving. Prasad implores Lalitha to act as Sita for a few days to secure his family, and she does. At this, she nears and grows attached to them. \nMeanwhile, Prasad collapses after identifying Sita's skeleton buried in the destruction via the bangles he bestowed. He recovers and decides to perform Lalitha's nuptial with Ramesh by granting the required dowry. However, Ramesh suspects Prasad & Lalitha's relationship. Thus, she rebukes and expels him.

Rama Rao, Krishna Kumari, Kantha Rao and Leelavathi with music composed by Ghantasala. The film is a remake of the 1951 Tamil film of the same name which was an adaptation of the novel Vengeance by Marie Corelli and William Shakespeare's play Macbeth.\n\nPlot\nOnce upon a time, in a kingdom, the King is enticed by a malevolent court dancer, Chanchala, and sets forth to knit her, which is barred by his brother-in-law Purushotham. So, the King ostracizes him and splices Chanchala, the wiles, to slay him with the two princes by drowning a boat. Years roll by, and Chanchala, as the Queen regnant, tramples the kingdom. However, she is ceaselessly haunted by a ghost for her sins. At that time, a sage, Marmayogi, was posted as the adviser, and his son Bhaskar was the commander. Besides, in the countryside, Prabhakar, a rebel, impedes the enormities of the Queen and shields the fatality. Purushotham also joins him. Since his presence becomes a hazard, the Queen uses various means to clutch him, but in vain. Hence, she utilizes Prabhavati as a spy who tactically enrolls in Prabhakar's team but later genuinely loves him, discerning his ideologies. Prabhakar gets periodic instructions from the Goddess, which he follows. Meanwhile, Prabhakar's aides are imprisoned with Prabhavati when he gallantly secures them and seizes the Queen. Therein, the ghost appears when she confesses her crimes. On the verge of beheading, Bhaskar onslaughts and captures everyone. Now, the Queen returns to her throne when Bhaskar detects the ghost is his father and the operative to Prabhakar. Hence, he moves forward to arrest when, as a flabbergast, he unveils himself as a King who escaped from death. Moreover, Prabhakar & Bhaskar are siblings, and Prabhavati is the progeny of Purushotham. At last, Chanchala commits suicide. Finally, the movie ends happily with the marriage and crowing ceremony of Prabhakar & Prabhavati.\n\nCast\nN. T.

    "synopsis": "Babruvahana is a 1964 Indian Telugu-language Hindu mythological film, produced by C. Jaganmohana Rao under the Sri National Art Pictures banner and directed by Samudrala Sr. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, S. Varalakshmi, Chalam, and music composed by Paamarthi. The film is based on the life of Babruvahana, one of the sons of Arjuna.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins at Dwaraka, where Krishna announces Rukmini arrival of Arjuna soon. Indeed, he is on an around-the-Earth trip for one year in atonement for the breach of Yudhishthira & Draupadi privacy. One night, when he is unwinding at the banks of the river Ganga. Nagaraja, Kouravya's daughter Ulupi allures and lifts him to Nagaloka. The two conjoin with Nagaraja's blessings. However, their chief minister, Dhrutarastra, is opposed to it. After a while, Arjuna advances to Manipura. He is impressed by its princess Chitrangada, and Emperor Vichitra Vahana approves their espousal, stipulating to bestow their 1st progeny as his heir. Parallelly, at Dwaraka Balarama fixes Subhadra's alliance with his Duryodhana, and Arjuna goes forth after Chitrangada conceives. Accordingly, he sets foot in the guise of a saint. Balarama warmly welcomes him, assigns Subhadra for his ministrations, and the two write a romantic poem. Krishna covetously conducts Arjuna & Subhadra's splice and conveys them to Indraprastha. \nMeanwhile, Chitrangada delivers a baby boy, Babruvahana, who grows up and surpasses Arjuna in archery. Now it is time for Yudhishthira's Ashvamedha after Kurukshetra War to establish sovereignty over the subcontinent. Arjuna spearheads the campaign with Karna's son, Vrishaketu. Besides, Ulupi is conscious about Ganga's curse that Arjuna burns on hell offense done to Bhishma on the battlefield. Ergo, Ulupi implores Ganga, who suggests a key if Arjuna so dies by any kinship cannot enforce it. Ulupi selects Babruvahana and accords him with the ultimate weapon for Arjuna's death. After crossing many kingdoms, Arjuna reaches Manipura, when Ulupi arouses the valor in Babruvahana and drives him to seize the sacred horse. Listening to it, Arjuna is despondent but also smug about having a remarkable son. On his mother's edict, Babruvahana moves to offer his submission, where Arjuna mortifies him, and he faces the pitcher with his father. Later, Chitrangada took off for negotiations, but to no avail. The war erupts, and Babruvahana holds off Arjuna's troops and kills Vishvaketu. After almighty rows, father & son encounter when Arjuna collapses by gun of his death. Devastated Babruvahana seeks his duty when Ulupi affirms that he should procure Sanjeevani-Mani from Nagaloka. So, he lands therein, but vicious Dhrutarastra refuses to grant since it is their race's boon. After facing many obstacles, Babruvahana gains it. Till then, Nagas's ruse flees by decapitating his head for Arjuna. At last, Krishna arrives, retrieves it with his Sudarshana Chakra, and awakes Arjuna with Sanjeevani-Mani. Finally, the move ends happily with the proclamation: There is a vital force beyond humans. It is to bind his narcissism as Supreme.\n\nCast\nN. T. Rama Rao as Arjuna\nS.

    "synopsis": "Punarjanma (transl. Rebirth) is a 1963 Indian Telugu-language drama film, produced by A. V. Subba Rao and directed by K. Pratyagatma. Based on the novel Patthar Ke Honth by Gulshan Nanda, it stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Krishna Kumari, with music composed by T. Chalapathi Rao. The film was remade in Hindi as Khilona (1970), in Tamil as Engirundho Vandhaal (1970) and in Malayalam as Amrithavaahini (1976).\n\nPlot\nGopi is the son of Zamindar and is a sculptor. He creates a statue and becomes passionate about his dream girl. Unfortunately, it catches fire and burns, and Gopi mentally breaks down. Before the rift, Gopi is in love with his cousin Vasanthi. However, Vasanthi's mother, Yasoda Devi, breaks the proposal. The doctor realizes that music helps Gopi, so he advises to appoint a beautiful girl who knows dance & music as his caretaker. Thus, his father, Zamindar, brings a lovely girl, Radha, from a \"Kothi\" to care for Gopi. Though Radha is born into a family of courtesans, she does not follow this path and longs to live a traditional family life. Radha does her best to serve Gopi and tries to make him sane. One day, when Radha is playing with dolls, in a mock marriage Bommala Pelli with the children of Zamindar's elder son, Gopi suddenly ties his deceased mother's wedding chain, Mangalsutra, on Radha's neck. Zamindar and his mother accept the new relationship as they understand Radha's virtues. In the care of Radha, Gopi gradually regains his sanity. However, he forgets Radha and renews his love for Vasanthi. A crestfallen Radha leaves the house and resumes her life as an entertainer. Meanwhile, Gopi is confused as some vague remembrances haunt him when Vasanthi reveals the truth, and he immediately rushes for Radha. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the reunion of Gopi & Radha.\n\nCast\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao as Gopi\nKrishna Kumari as Radha\nRamana Reddy as Professor\nGummadi as Zamindar\nPadmanabham as Raja Rao\nPrabhakar Reddy as Gopi's Brother\nRaja Babu Basava Rao\nChadalavada as Radha's Uncle\nSuryakantam as Yashoda Devì\nHemalatha as Gopi's Grandmother\nL.

    "synopsis": "Lava Kusa (also spelled as Lava Kusha) is a 1963 Indian Hindu mythological film directed by C. Pullayya and C. S. Rao. Produced by Lalita Sivajyothi Films, the film is a remake of the 1934 production of the same name, which was also directed by C. Pullayya. The story is based on the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana, focusing on Lava and Kusa, the twin sons of Rama and Sita. The cast includes N. T. Rama Rao as Rama, Anjali Devi as Sita, with Chittoor Nagayya, Kantha Rao, Sobhan Babu, S. Varalakshmi, and Kaikala Satyanarayana in supporting roles. The soundtrack features 27 songs, with the musical score primarily composed by Ghantasala.\nProduction of the film began in 1958 but was stopped due to financial constraints. When it restarted, Pullayya's health was deteriorating, so his son C. S. Rao took over. Lava Kusa is notable for being the first full-length colour film in Telugu cinema. The film was shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil, with minor differences in the cast. It was released on 29 March 1963 in Telugu and on 19 April 1963 in Tamil. Lava Kusa was a major commercial success, running for 75 weeks and grossing over ₹1 crore. The Telugu version won the National Film Award for Best Telugu Feature Film. The film was also dubbed in Kannada and later in Hindi in 1974. In 2011, it was rebooted as Sri Rama Rajyam.\n\nPlot\nThe film is based on the Uttara Kanda, the later part of the Ramayana attributed to Valmiki. It follows the lives of Lava and Kusa, the twin sons of Sita and Rama. The story begins with the Pattabhishekam (coronation) of Rama and the brief period of Rama Rajyam. However, after hearing accusations from a washerman about Sita's chastity, Rama sends her into exile. In the forest, Sita gives birth to Lava and Kusa. As they grow up, the twins eventually visit Ayodhya. The story also covers the Aswamedha Yagna performed by Rama and the resulting conflict between him and his sons, which culminates in the Pattabhishekam of Lava and Kusa. The film concludes with Rama ending his avatar and returning to the divine.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\nProducer A. Sankara Reddy aimed to make a film based on the Hindu epic Ramayana, with N. T. Rama Rao and Anjali Devi playing the roles of Rama and Sita. This inspiration came after watching them perform as Rama and Sita in the song \"Murisenu Lokamu\" from his earlier film Charana Dasi (1956). Sankara Reddy approached director C. Pullayya, who had plans to remake his 1934 Telugu film Lava Kusa, to direct the film under his production banner, Lalitha Sivajyothi Films. The remake, also titled Lava Kusa, became the first full-length colour film in Telugu cinema. Screenwriter Vempati Sadasivabrahmam, who had previously worked with Pullayya on Charana Dasi, was hired to script the film. Sadasivabrahmam remained faithful to the original screenplay by Vallabhajosyula Ramanamurthy and the dialogues written by Balijepalli Lakshmikantham.\nThe production costs increased significantly when Sankara Reddy decided to shoot the film in colour. Although production started in 1958, it stalled after one-third of the planned portions were completed due to financial difficulties. After five years, Sunderlal Nahata agreed to fund the project in exchange for distribution rights, while B. Nagi Reddi provided studio facilities. By this time, C. Pullayya's health had deteriorated, and Sankara Reddy initially approached B. N. Reddi to complete the film. B. N. Reddi suggested that C. Pullayya's son, C. S. Rao, should take over the project. Though initially hesitant, C. S. Rao agreed to complete the film after his father convinced him that the emotional scenes set in Rama's palace were crucial to the story.\n\nCasting\nLava Kusa was filmed as a bilingual in both Telugu and Tamil with variations in the cast. In the Telugu version, Anaparthi Nagaraju and Viyyuri Subrahmanyam were cast as Lava and Kusa, respectively. For the Tamil version, the roles were portrayed by Baby Uma and Master Murali. Subrahmanyam was selected after the filmmakers saw him perform the role of Kusa in a play in Kakinada. He was nine years old when production started and 14 by the time the film was released. Unlike Subrahmanyam, Nagaraju had previously acted in a few films. Pullayya offered him the role of Lava after observing his performance, and he was eight years old when filming commenced.\nKantha Rao was cast as Lakshmana, but during production, he was diagnosed with eosinophilia and gained weight. He was then considered for the role of Satrughna. N. T. Rama Rao insisted that Kantha Rao play Lakshmana, and Sobhan Babu was cast as Satrughna instead. Other prominent cast members included Kaikala Satyanarayana as Bharata, Chittor V. Nagayya as Valmiki, and Sando Krishna as Anjaneya.\n\nFilming\n\nNagaraju and Subrahmanyam underwent daily training sessions for an hour to memorize dialogues and practice archery for their roles. Filming usually started at 7:00 AM and continued until 9:00 PM, but the child actors were released an hour earlier to ensure they got enough rest. According to the actors, N. T. Rama Rao and Anjali Devi were fully dedicated to their roles. When none of the crowns designed for Rama suited him, Rama Rao used the crown he had worn in Charanadasi, which costed only ₹140 at the time.\nIn one scene, where Nagaraju had to cry, glycerin was used but proved ineffective. Anjali Devi then slapped him to evoke genuine tears, and the scene was successfully filmed. Afterward, she consoled him for 15 minutes. \nThe climax sequences were filmed first, which caused a continuity issue when the child actors appeared older in the scenes filmed later due to the delays in production. In the scene where Rama embraces Lava and Kusa, Pullayya had the child actors stand on small tables to match Rama Rao's height, showcasing his respect for the character and the limitations of the technology available at the time. Pullayya's associate, G. V. R. Seshagiri Rao, suggested reshooting a scene where a pregnant Sita runs toward Valmiki, as it appeared awkward.\n\nMusic\nThe music of Lava Kusa was composed by Ghantasala. The Tamil version has additional music by K. V. Mahadevan.\n\nReception\nLava Kusa achieved significant commercial success, running uninterrupted for 75 weeks, a record in Telugu cinema. The film was released in 26 centres and achieved a 100-day run in all of them, a remarkable feat at the time. It went on to have a 150-day run in those centres and a 175-day run in 18 centres. Due to high demand, many film prints had to be relocated to different centres across Andhra Pradesh. Overall, the film ran for 100 days in 62 centres and had a 175-day run in 18 centres, grossing more than ₹1 crore.\n\nAccolades\nNational Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu\n\nLegacy\nLava Kusa is regarded as a classic in Telugu cinema. In January 2007, M. L. Narasimham of The Hindu included the film in a list of significant works, alongside Mala Pilla (1938), Raithu Bidda (1939), Vara Vikrayam (1939), Bhakta Potana (1942), Shavukaru (1950), Malliswari (1951), Peddamanushulu (1954), and Mayabazar (1955), citing their influence on society and Telugu cinema. N. T. Rama Rao's portrayal of Rama in Lava Kusa became iconic, leading him to reprise the role in several other films over the next two decades.\nDuring the programme Telugu Cinema Prasthanam organized by the film society of Visakhapatnam, actor and writer Ravi Kondala Rao highlighted Lava Kusa as one of the cult films that defined Telugu cinema. He compared it to other landmark films such as Raja Harishchandra (1913), Bhakta Prahlada (1932), Mala Pilla (1938), Pathala Bhairavi (1951), and Devadasu (1953). In 2011, director Bapu adapted the storyline of Lava Kusa for his film Sri Rama Rajyam, which featured Rama Rao's son, Nandamuri Balakrishna.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nLava Kusa at IMDb"

    "synopsis": "Bandipotu (transl. Bandit) is a 1963 Indian Telugu-language swashbuckler film directed by B. Vittalacharya. It stars N. T. Rama Rao and Krishna Kumari, with music composed by Ghantasala. Tripuraneni Maharadhi wrote the story and dialogues. The film was produced by Sunderlal Nehataa and Doondy under the Raja Lakshmi Productions banner. Vittalacharya shot the film simultaneously in Kannada as Veera Kesari (1963), with Rajkumar. This film had its climax scene in Eastmancolor.\n\nPlot\nOnce upon a time, there was a kingdom called Gandhara whose King, Sathya Sena, had a paralyzed leg. Exploiting it, his vicious brother-in-law, Soora Simha, grabs the authority and tramples the public under the toe. Plus, he plots to ascend the throne by knitting Princess Mandara Mala. Hence, a man under the veil, Asahayasoora, rebels against the tyranny that heists the royal wealth and benefits the needy. However, Soora Simha poses him as a bandit before the King and incriminates him for all his sins. Once, Asahayasoora looted Mala, who was on an excursion, and a gallant Narasimha hindered it. In the combat, Asahayasoora bows to his bravery and learns he is a son of gentlemen & patriot Salva Dharma Nayaka. Narasimha falls for Mala at first sight when she irks because of her race's pride. \nNext, he backs Asahayasoora to his secret base, where he is startled to unveil him as his father's sibling, Veera Nayaka. Hereupon, Narasimha is conscious of destabilizing the country, Soora Simha's hellish hue, and the eminence of his uncle. Now he declares to conjoin his uncle, which Dharma Nayaka bars, and orders him never to meet Veera Nayaka. Meanwhile, Soora Simha learns about Asahayasoora's genesis and mandates the arrest of Dharma Nayaka. Being aware of Dharma Nayaka's royal devotion, Satya Sena calls him respectfully. Therein, Dharma Nayaka proclaims to prove his brother as nonguilty and reveal the actual killers. Ergo, Satya Sena opens a chance, and he walks on to retrieve him. Bewaring of the upshot, Veera Nayaka moves to protect his elder's honor. Soora Simha backstabs them in midway to cover his cabals. \nSpotting it, Narasimha bursts out, pledges to continue his uncle's legacy, and arouses a public revolt. From there, he turns tough nut to Soora Simha and mocks him in various disguises. After a while, Mala comprehends his virtue and truly endears him. Discerning it, Soora Simha ruses by abducting Mala on behalf of Narasimha. Moreover, he slyly intrudes his amour Rajani into mutineers, and by her, they seize Narasimha. In royalty, he freaks out about the brutalities of Soora Simha, but Satya Sena mandates the death penalty, which he tactically skips. Parallelly, Mala runs from Soora Simha's clutches, and she divulges the actuality to her father. By then, the malice surrounds and imprisons them. At last, Narasimha secures them and ceases Soora Simha. Finally, the movie ends happily with Satya Sena bestowing the crown & Mandara Mala on him.\n\nCast\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMusic composed by Ghantasala. The songs \"Vagala Ranivineeve\" and \"Uhalu Gusagusalade\" are evergreen blockbusters. Music released by SAREGAMA Audio Company. \n\nReception\nT. M. Ramachandran of Sport and Pastime praised the cast and crew of the film.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBandipotu at IMDb"

Rajeswara Rao.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins in the court of Brahma, where Mahabhisha & Ganga lures each other, and the lord curses them to be born as mortals  Mahabhisha takes birth as Shantanu in the Kuru dynasty, meets Ganga, and knits her on a condition not to question her actions  Time passes, and Ganga gives birth to 7 children and drowns them in the river  During the turn of the eighth one, devastated, Shantanu confronts her when she disappears with the child who grows up to be Devavratha, a great warrior trained by Parasurama  Once he is acquainted with the father while hunting, Ganga unites them and quits  A few years later, Shantanu attracts Satyavati, the daughter of Dasaraju. So, he moves with the proposal, which they accept, provided Satyavati's son would inherit the throne of Hastinapur. Hence, Devavratha pledges a mighty vow of lifelong celibacy and service to whoever sat on the throne of their dynasty, which debilitates him as Bhishma, and his father gives him a boon that death will not be near him until he calls. \nAfter some time, Shantanu passes away, and Satyavati's son Vichitravirya becomes the king; Bhishma decides to perform his nuptial with the princesses of Kaasi Amba, Ambika, & Ambalika  However, the Kaasi king affronts not submitting the proposal to Hastinapur as Satyavati belongs to the grassroots  So, enraged Bhishma abducts the princesses  Following, Amba proclaims her love for Salwa when Bhishma honorably sends her back  Salwa denies her when Amba returns to Bhishma and asks him to splice, which is impossible because of his oath  Then Amba approaches Parasurama, who edicts Bhishma but in vain, and the war erupts, and Bhishma defeats his mentor  Accordingly, Amba takes a pledge to seek to avenge Bhishma, performs immense penance to please Siva, and takes a boon that she will cause Bhishma's death  Next, Amba reincarnates as Sikhandi, a woman who later transforms into a man  The Kurukshetra war begins, which designates Bhishma as the supreme commander of the Kaurava, and Pandavas are unable to defeat him for ten days  Ergo, on the tactic of Krishna, Arjuna shoots Bhishma, keeping Sikhandi in front, and he collapses on Ampashayya, the arrow bed  After the completion of the war, Bhishma leaves his breath on Uttarayana Punyakalam, and Krishna bestows him a boon that the universe celebrates the day as Bhishma Ekadashi.\n\nCast\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMusic composed by S. Rajeswara Rao. Lyrics were written by Aarudhra.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBhishma at IMDb"

    "synopsis": "Aradhana (transl. Devotion)  is a 1962 Indian Telugu-language romance film produced by V. B. Rajendra Prasad and D. Ranga Rao, and directed by V. Madhusudhana Rao. The film stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Savitri, with music composed by S. Rajeswara Rao. It is a remake of the Bengali film Sagarika (1956). The film was released on 16 February 1962, and emerged a box office success.\n\nPlot\nDr. Murali Krishna, an introvert, aspires to study abroad as his mother's last wish. Appreciating his dedication, the medical college principal, V. R. Rao, approves the scholarship. During that time, Krishna falls in love with another medical student, Anuradha. Sarala, who loves Krishna, is jealous of Anuradha. So, she writes a love letter to Anuradha in the name of Krishna, which makes her furious, and she complains to Rao. As a result, Krishna loses his scholarship. Humiliated, Krishna gets back to the village. His father, Gopalam, decides to send Krishna abroad at any cost. So, he approaches a crafty, wealthy person in their town, Lingaiah, who grants the amount stipulating that he must couple up his daughter Lakshmi with Krishna. Helpless, Gopalam accepts the deal, and Krishna leaves. After that, Dr. Saradhi, a close friend of Krishna, chides Anuradha even though Sarala repents and admits her mistake. Now, Anuradha starts loving Krishna when the wheel of fortune makes Lingaiah her paternal uncle. He announces the marriage proposal and requests Anuradha to educate and transform Lakshmi into a fashionable young lady. Knowing it, Anuradha collapses but withstands and moves forward with her entrusted responsibility. \nMeanwhile, Gopalam apprises Krishna regarding the promise given to Lingaiah and asks him to communicate with Lakshmi at Anuradha's address. Lakshmi falls for her cousin Yoganandam in the city, becomes carefree, and shows no interest in Krishna. At present, Anuradha writes replies to Krishna on behalf of Lakshmi, and both close in. Krishna loses his eyesight in an accident when Lingaiah drops the match, and everyone quits Krishna. After returning, Anuradha serves him out of adoration by purporting herself as Lakshmi. After some time, Rao and Saradhi plan surgery to regain Krishna's eyesight. Lakshmi senses the love affair of Krishna and Anuradha, so she accuses and elopes with Yoganandam, but Lingaiah forcibly brings her back. Soon after the surgery, Anuradha disappears, replacing Lakshmi, but Krishna discerns and perturbs Lakshmi, who served him, which leads to loss of recouped sight. Here, Lingaiah and Saradhi convince and get back Anuradha when Krishna becomes normal and learns the truth. Finally, the movie ends happily with the marriages of Krishna & Anuradha and Yoganandam & Lakshmi.\n\nCast\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao as Muralikrishna\nSavitri as Anuradha\nJaggayya as Saradhi\nGummadi as V. R. Rao\nRelangi as Yoganandam\nRamana Reddy as Lingaiah\nDr. Sivaramakrishnaiah as Bondam\nRajasree as Sarala\nGirija as Lakshmi\nL. Vijayalakshmi (special appearance in the song \"Emanta Emanta\")\n\nProduction\nAradhana is a remake of the Bengali film Sagarika (1956).

While the film was predominantly in black-and-white, this song alone was filmed in colour.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe music was composed by S. Rajeswara Rao. The song \"Na Hrudayamlo Nidurinche Cheli\" is based on \"Amar Shopne Dekha Rajkkonna Thaake\" from the original Bengali film.\n\nRelease\nAradhana was released on 16 February 1962 and emerged a box office success, running for over 100 days in theatres.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\nRajadhyaksha, Ashish; Willemen, Paul (1998) .

Chandra prays to Siva, who defends him. Thus, war erupts between Daksha & Siva, pacified by Vishnu by dividing Chandra into two. However, Daksha maintains his grudge against Siva. During this, he is aware of Sati's love affair, so he seeks her alliance, but Sati splices Siva against her father's wish. Infuriated, Daksha decides to disgrace Siva by failing to give a share in a sacrifice. Sati uninvitedly visits the function, ignoring her husband's advice, where Daksha mortifies her. As a result, she immolated herself in the sacrificial fire. Hearing it, Siva makes a ferocious dance, Rudra Thandavam, and wakes Veerabhadra from his hair, destroying the sacrifice and decapitating Daksha.

Rama Rao and Anjali Devi, with music composed by Ramesh Naidu.\n\nPlot\nShanta is a naïve girl lusted by a landlord, Rangaiah, who attempts to molest her. Whereat, her father dies, and she absconds, but a mobster, Dayanidhi, clutches her and skips from him. Amid this, an Advocate, Srinivas, a widower, acquaints and shelters her. Hereupon, his son Kumar assumed Shanta was his mother, and she reciprocated with doting affection. Following, Srinivas endears Shanta and knits her, and the two are blessed with a son, Venu. On occasion, Shanta is terrified of viewing Dayanidhi as Srinivas's friend but quiets. Next, Dayanidhi cabals will slay Srinivas via maid Rajyam by poisoning. Tragically, Kumar dies, which incriminates Shanta when fierce Srinivas expels her. Dayanidhi is about to snatch Shanta, who escapes and seeks to kill herself. Then, she hears the baby cry and spots Shyamala, whom Dayanidhi victimizes. Before dying, she entrusts the baby's responsibility to Shanta and fosters her as Saroja. Once, Srinivas spots them and suspects Shanta's chastity. Years roll by, and destiny makes Venu & Saroja collegians, and they crush. Srinivas denies it by looking at Shanta, who begs him to state the fact, but in vain. The rest of the story is about how the truth comes forward and how the family is reunited.\n\nCast\nN. T.

Since Radha is restricted, Lakshmi Kanthamma and Kamala stay back. At that juncture, Venu meets his childhood friend OS Rao & his wife Suguna as neighbors. Currently, Venu cannot bear to spend on Radha and cannot allocate the budget for his mother. Hence, the lenders auction their houses for debt. So, helplessly, Lakshmi Kanthamma and Kamala reach Venu, where Radha humiliates them. Once, when Venu is in camp, she attributes a heist to Kamala, which makes them leave the house. On the way, Lakshmi Kanthamma encounters an accident made by Kaasulu who shelters them, without the choice of his stingy father Singaraju Lingaraju a millionaire, and Kaasulu crushes Kamala. Soon after the return, Venu realizes the fact and searches for his family. During that time, Radha misuses his bank treasure for her false prestige. Grief-stricken Venu turns back, detects Radha's offense, rebukes, and gets arrested. Fourthly, Radha seeks her father's help, which he denies, but later steps in after perceiving the value of love and affection through Suguna. Because of the plight, Lakshmi Kanthamma attempts a theft at Lingaraju's house, which Kaasulu notices allows the required amount. Right now, she secretly hands it over to Rao and proceeds to commit suicide but is caught by the police. Eventually, Lingaraju identifies the theft, forcibly takes Kamala to the Police Station when Kaasulu arrives, and admits the truth. By the time Rao acquits Venu when Radha arrives, they also learn about the presence of Lakshmi Kanthamma therein. At last, Radha pleads for pardon, and even Lingaraju repents. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Kaasulu & Kamala.\n\nCast\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao as Venu\nSavitri as Radha\nKrishna Kumari as Kamala\nV. Nagayya as Doctor\nRelangi as O.

    "synopsis": "Bala Nagamma is a 1959 Indian Telugu-language fantasy swashbuckler film directed by Vedantam Raghavayya. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao, Anjali Devi, and S. V. Ranga Rao with music composed by T. V. Raju. It is a remake of the 1942 Telugu film of the same name.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with Queen Bhulakshmi, wife of King Nava Bhoja, penances Shiva for progeny. Ultimately, she acquires the boon, and according to the Lord's mandate, she procures a fruit from the tree by stepping on an anthill. At this, enraged Nagendra is about to kill her, but she begs for life until her motherhood. After a while, Bhulakshmi is blessed with seven daughters and decides to repent. Anyhow, Nava Bhoja bars and attempts to shield her but gets a victim of a snake bite and dies. Now, the King coercively knits a shrew, Manikyamba, who oppress the kids. Plus, she molds Nava Bhoja, a henpecked husband, via a witchcraft paste and goads him to slaughter the girls. Generous father cannot make it, so he quits them in the forest, where the Bhulakshmi aura rears them.\nYears pass, and King Ramavardhi, the ruler of Panuganti, is the sibling of Bhulakshmi, who sends his seven sons to detect his niece. Whereat, the younger Karyavardhi, spots the last girl, Balanagamma, and they crush. Now, the seven sisters' splices, their cousins, Karyavardhi & Balanagamma, are blessed with a baby boy, Balavardhi. Besides, Mayala Marathi,  the splenetic wizard, resides on the outskirts of his ghost den. Once, he challenges his paramour Sangu to nab a gorgeous in the universe and picks Balanagamma. At the same time, Karyavardhi proceeds to the battlefield, drawing a chalk outline for protection and designating his acolyte, Thalari Ramudu, as a guard. However, Marathi's chicanery abducts Balanagamma by transforming her into a dog. Knowing it, Karyavardhi onslaughts with his men on Marathi, whom he turns as the status and even incinerates Sangu. Spotting it, Balanagamma attempts suicide, and Bhulakshmi's aura secures her, stating that her son will safeguard her at the age of 12. Hereupon, Balanagamma tactically resisted Marathi for 12 years.\nAs time passes, Balavardhi learns about Marathi's atrocity. Ergo pledges to relieve his parents and steps in with Thalari Ramudu. Amid this, he shields a kingdom from a tiger hunt and conjoins its princess. Following, seeking guidance from Nagendra, Balavardhi intrudes into Marathi's palace through a florist, Tambala Pedi. He is acquainted with his mother and, with wit, extracts the life secret of Marathi, i.e., amalgamated beyond the seven seas; one pillar is the floor and in the parrot's neck. Balavardhi acquires it after an adventurous journey. At last, he ceases Marathi, making his father & family normal. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with a family reunion.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\nBala Nagamma was remade from the 1942 film of the same name. Relangi and Lanka Satyam, who appeared in the 1942 film, returned in the remake.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nTelugu Songs\nThe soundtrack of the film was composed by T. V. Raju, while the lyrics were written by Samudrala Jr.\nPlayback singers are Ghantasala, Pithapuram Nageswara Rao, P. Leela, Jikki, P. Susheela, S. Janaki and K. Rani.\n\nTamil Songs\nMusic by Pamarthi. Lyrics by Kuyilan and Kambadasan.\n\nReception\nThe Indian Express in its review dated 11 March 1960 reviewing the Tamil-dubbed version noted the theme \"will not be without fascination for our Tamil folk on account of the touch of the super-natural dominating the theme\" but praised S. V. Ranga Rao as \"providing major attraction\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBala Nagamma at IMDb"

Rajeswara Rao. It was simultaneously shot in Telugu and Tamil languages, with most of the actors and scenes being the same in both versions. Another Chenchu Lakshmi was earlier made in 1943 with a different cast and crew.\n\nPlot\nThe film is based on the Hindu mythological story, which begins with the weddings of Vishnu & Lakshmi. During this, Durvasa is furious as he is uninvited and curses Mahalakshmi's parents, Samudra & his wife, to be born as tribals. After a while, Vishnu kills Hiranyaksha, donning a Varaha avatar. Learning it, his brother Hiranyakashipu, a ferocious, performs a vast penance. Exploiting it, Indra kidnaps his pregnant wife, Leelavathi, to destroy his heir. Narada safeguards her and sculpts Prahlada in her womb as an ardent devotee of Vishnu.\nMeanwhile, Hiranyakasipa triumphs and gets a boon from Brahma: the absence of death of any weapon, human, animal, demon, or divinity. Now, he trounces the universe and moves in search of Vishnu, who absconds with Lakshmi. He transforms Lakshmi's glow into fruit and plants it on a tree. Samudra & his wife take birth as the tribals but are perturbed as childless. So, Narada tricks by bestowing the fruit to them and the couple is blessed with a baby girl, Chenchita. Besides, Prahlada's worship of Vishnu reaches esteem, and Hiranyakasipa makes several attempts to bar him but in vain. He challenges to show his God when Vishnu appears from the pillar as Narasimha, half man & half lion and slays Hiranyakasipa.\nNarasimha is still raging with fury here, and no one can make him calm, including Lakshmi, because she does not obtain the glow. During that plight, Narasimha is acquainted with fearless Chenchita, who subsides his anger and turns into the handsome Narahari, and they knit. Being aware of it, Lakshmi displays grievance, and the two wives squabble. At last, Narada affirms Chenchita is her glows when they conjoin, and Samudra & his wife are also relieved from the curse. The film ends with the reunion of Vishnu & Lakshmi at Vaikuntha.\n\nCast\n\nSoundtrack\nMusic was composed by S. Rajeswara Rao.

Parallelly, his shrew sibling Nanchari, who is also carrying, intrudes into their house with her husband, Seshachalam. The two deliver baby boys, Gopal & Prabhakar, at a time when the avid Simhachalam couple swap them to usurp the wealth. After a while, Mahalakshmi's cousin Madhava Rao serves a sentence in prison when his wife, Ranganayaki, pleads for shelter. Nevertheless, Nanchari gets her out and injects her into Tirumala Rao. Incognizant Madhava Rao absconds to view Ranganayaki and reaches therein. Exploiting it, sly Nanchari makes Tirumala Rao expel Mahalakshmi by imputing taint. So, she attempts suicide and seeks asylum in an orphanage. Following, the Simhachalam couple disposes of Gopal at the gate of the same orphanage, counterfeiting his death. Destiny makes Mahalakshmi adopt him, which Simhachalam also beholds and informs Nanchari. Later, they have a baby girl, Shobha. Forthwith, Tirumala Rao affirms her espousal with Prabhakar. Since the siblings' nuptial is engaged, Nanchari is scared, but Simhachalam comforts her, saying let's get on if it comes. \nYears pass, and Prabhakar becomes a menacing hoodlum conducting havoc loots in the town with his moll Rita. Gopal is a spirited cop nurtured by Mahalakshmi, who is specially assigned to capture these criminals. Though Simhachalam passes away, Tirumala Rao stands on to knit Prabhakar & Shobha, which Nanchari bans from time to time. Gopal starts his investigation with his acolyte Bhadrachalam and turns tough nut to mobsters. During a burglary, they identify Prabhakar's vehicle as driven by Rita. Gopal misinterprets her for Shobha and joins the disguised form of a driver at Tirumala Rao's residence. Due to police suspicion hikes, Prabhakar heists his house for assets, which Nanchari & Shobha view, but be quiet. Gopal chases Shobha when they crush, and he learns that Prabhakar is the culprit. Nanchari gazes at Shobha's love affair and confirms Gopal is the true heir of his brother, knowing his whereabouts. \nOnce, Prabhakar walks to warn Gopal that Mahalakshmi is delighted to get him wrong like her own. At this, she is aware of the dark shade of Prabhakar and Gopal's endearment of Shobha. So, she takes a word from Gopal to forget Shobha in favor of her son. Tirumala Rao collapses, becoming conscious of Prabhakar's hellish hue. Ergo, to reform him, he forcibly arranges wedlock for Prabhakar & Shobha when Nanchari is absent. Parallelly, Gopal is ready to round up the gang, which Mahalakshmi notifies Prabhakar, and he seizes him. During the nuptial, Mahalakshmi also covetously enters when Nanchari lands to bar it when Prabhakar assaults her and skips, locking Shobha. Before leaving her breath, Nanchari divulges her sins with Gopal's birth secret and unites Tirumala Rao & Mahalakshmi. At last, Gopal ceases Prabhakar and merges with his family.

    "synopsis": "Bhookailas is a 1958 Indian Telugu-language Hindu mythological film directed by K. Shankar. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Jamuna with music composed by R. Sudarsanam and R. Govardhanam. It was produced by A. V. Meiyappan under the AVM Productions banner.\nThe story is based on the Sthala Purana of Gokarna Kshetram in Karnataka. Previously, a film was made with the same story casting in Telugu in 1940 with the same title which was an adaptation of the famous Kannada stage play Bhookailasa by Sri Sahitya Samrajya Nataka Mandali of Mysore. A. V. Meiyappan also shot the movie simultaneously in Kannada as Bhookailasa starring Rajkumar.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins at Lanka, where its Empire Ravana trounces the Earth and declares to invade Amaravati. Narada keeps posting it to Indra and proclaims Ravana's power secret is devotion to his mother Kaikashi. Every day, she worships Saikathalingam, a sand sculptured Siva at the banks of the sea. So, Indra sabotages Kaikashi's prayers when enraged Ravana pledges to gift Atmalingam, i.e., the Lord's soul, to her and walks on to penance. Midway, Ravana meets Narada and divulges his intention. Hearing it, Parvati discomposes and bows before Vishnu for her husband's consort, who swears to help. Ravana underwent rigorous penance when stirred Siva & Parvati appeared. Vishnu manipulates an illusion that makes Ravana lust for Parvati and asks her, which the Lord grants. Parvati is cognizant of Vishnu's play and curses him to weep by detaching from his wife. \nListening to it, Narada is on cloud nine as a glorifying welcome sign of Ramavatar. Parvati morphs into Bhadrakali, and Ravana is startled when Narada tells him that Siva has endorsed a duplicate. Hence, he withdraws her at Siva and is searching for the original. At this point, Ravana is spotted by Mandodari, the daughter of Mayasura, ruler of Patala, who crushes on him at first sight. Narada poses her as Parvati, so she sets foot in their world. Initially, Mayasura defies the match since he is Vishnu's ardent devotee and Ravana is his antagonist. Narada straightens it out and performs the nuptials of Ravana & Mandodari. Soon after reaching home, Kaikashi questions Atmalingam when he states what happened, and she rebukes him. Learning the antecedents of Mandodari Ravana is violated by Narada, whose angered counsel extracts his illusion. Then, Ravana dies out of repentance and attempts self-sacrifice. Kaikashi bars it, enlightening him to give it another shot with unvarying initiation. \nThus, Ravana moves on and seeks regret before the Lord by decapitating. Elated Siva bestows him Atmalingam and edicts avoid putting it on the ground before landing in Lanka. Narada intends to hinder it and instigates Ganesha, who disguises himself as a Brahmin boy. Amidst, Ravana must fulfill the ritual to Surya when he gets the boy's aid to hold the Atmalingam. The boy stipulates that he will call him thrice and, if not, place it on the Earth. Accordingly, he alarms him thrice and puts it down. Infuriated, Ravana jumps onto Vigneswara, whom Narada pacifies. Next, he struggles his extent to re-extract Atmalingam but fails. Ergo collapses and implores before the statue because he cannot keep up his word. At last, Siva arises with Parvati & Ganesha, proclaiming that the idolatry took place since it is sanctum, and his story will be immortal.

    "synopsis": "Anna Thammudu (transl. Elder Brother and Younger Brother) is a 1958 Telugu-language drama film, produced by Kadaru Venkateswara Rao under the Sri Raja Rajeswari Film Company banner and directed by C. S. Rao. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Jaggayya, Sowcar Janaki and music composed by Ashwatthama.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with a wealthy Madhav Rao, who lives with his pregnant wife Shantamma and son Ravi. He is on odd terms with his debauchery sibling, Nageswara Rao, who loathes his brother for sentencing him to prison in the past. He returns home when Madhav Rao is ailing, sneakily slaughters him, and usurps the property by deceiving Shantamma. He sneaks in his girlfriend Vajram and associate Brahmandam into the house. Upon knowing Shantamma is pregnant, he ploys to slay her and Ravi to eliminate heirs to Madhava Rao's property. Shantamma absconds and when she faints, a thief lifts Ravi and he is secured by a couple. After bestirring, Shantamma is forlorn as Ravi is misled when a church father, Joseph, guards her where she delivers the second son Rajendra. Ranganna, a stanch of Madhav Rao, is in quest of his lords and detects Ravi at his sister's residence. Meanwhile, Nageswara Rao senses Shantamma's existence and wiles to wipe her out when she is unexpectedly incriminated as homicide and is sentenced. Now, Father Joseph joins Rajendra in Madras boarding school. \nYears pass, Ranganna raises Ravi with his niece Padma, and Rajendra becomes a solicitor. Ravi dotes on Padma as a sibling. Nageswara Rao also resides in Madras with Vajram. After acquitting, Shantamma too lands therein, and being unbeknownst, Rajendra shelters her as his mother. Rajendra loves Rani, the daughter of Nageswara Rao's clerk, Purushottama Rao. One day, Nageswara Rao traps and tries to molest Padma, and she jumps from the balcony to save herself, resulting in her death. Before breathing her last, she divulges the fact to Ravi. Ravi intrudes into Nageswara Rao's house and attempts to kill him. During the fight, Nageswara Rao accidentally kills Vajram and incriminates Ravi in the murder. After being arrested, Ravi escapes from prison and hides from the police.\nNageswara Rao lusts after Rani and ruses to splice her by trying to strike a deal with Purushottama Rao to give his daughter's hand in marriage. However, Rajendra saves his honor and Purushottama Rao performs Rani's marriage with Rajendra upon realizing their love affair. Ravi returns and tries to kill Nageswara Rao again but flees when the police arrive. The police shoot him, and he lands at Rajendra's residence, where Shantamma saves him from the police and thus frustrates Rajendra. Nageswara Rao lures Rani to his house under the pretense of Rajendra being ill, but Ravi comes to her rescue. Ranganna arrives at the same time and tries to kill Nageswara Rao; when Ranganna is injured, Ravi finally kills Nageswara Rao. Ranganna discloses that Ravi is Shantamma's elder son, and they reunite, after which Ravi is arrested. Ravi is produced before the judiciary, and Rajendra is the judge. The night before the final court hearing, Father Joseph arrives, recognizes Shantamma, and unites Rajendra with his mother.

    "synopsis": "Inti Guttu (transl. Family Secret) is a 1958 Indian Telugu-language drama film, produced by Akella Sastry and directed by Vedantam Raghavayya. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Savitri with music composed by M. S. Prakash. It is a partly based on the Hindi film Munimji (1955).\n\nPlot\nZamindar Tirumala Rao leads a jollity life with his benevolent wife, Mahalakshmi, and will be blessed with a child. Parallelly, his shrew sibling Nanchari, who is also carrying, intrudes into their house with her husband, Seshachalam. The two deliver baby boys, Gopal & Prabhakar, at a time when the avid Simhachalam couple swap them to usurp the wealth. After a while, Mahalakshmi's cousin Madhava Rao serves a sentence in prison when his wife, Ranganayaki, pleads for shelter. Nevertheless, Nanchari gets her out and injects her into Tirumala Rao. Incognizant Madhava Rao absconds to view Ranganayaki and reaches therein. Exploiting it, sly Nanchari makes Tirumala Rao expel Mahalakshmi by imputing taint. So, she attempts suicide and seeks asylum in an orphanage. Following, the Simhachalam couple disposes of Gopal at the gate of the same orphanage, counterfeiting his death. Destiny makes Mahalakshmi adopt him, which Simhachalam also beholds and informs Nanchari. Later, they have a baby girl, Shobha. Forthwith, Tirumala Rao affirms her espousal with Prabhakar. Since the siblings' nuptial is engaged, Nanchari is scared, but Simhachalam comforts her, saying let's get on if it comes. \nYears pass, and Prabhakar becomes a menacing hoodlum conducting havoc loots in the town with his moll Rita. Gopal is a spirited cop nurtured by Mahalakshmi, who is specially assigned to capture these criminals. Though Simhachalam passes away, Tirumala Rao stands on to knit Prabhakar & Shobha, which Nanchari bans from time to time. Gopal starts his investigation with his acolyte Bhadrachalam and turns tough nut to mobsters. During a burglary, they identify Prabhakar's vehicle as driven by Rita. Gopal misinterprets her for Shobha and joins the disguised form of a driver at Tirumala Rao's residence. Due to police suspicion hikes, Prabhakar heists his house for assets, which Nanchari & Shobha view, but be quiet. Gopal chases Shobha when they crush, and he learns that Prabhakar is the culprit. Nanchari gazes at Shobha's love affair and confirms Gopal is the true heir of his brother, knowing his whereabouts. \nOnce, Prabhakar walks to warn Gopal that Mahalakshmi is delighted to get him wrong like her own. At this, she is aware of the dark shade of Prabhakar and Gopal's endearment of Shobha. So, she takes a word from Gopal to forget Shobha in favor of her son. Tirumala Rao collapses, becoming conscious of Prabhakar's hellish hue. Ergo, to reform him, he forcibly arranges wedlock for Prabhakar & Shobha when Nanchari is absent. Parallelly, Gopal is ready to round up the gang, which Mahalakshmi notifies Prabhakar, and he seizes him. During the nuptial, Mahalakshmi also covetously enters when Nanchari lands to bar it when Prabhakar assaults her and skips, locking Shobha. Before leaving her breath, Nanchari divulges her sins with Gopal's birth secret and unites Tirumala Rao & Mahalakshmi. At last, Gopal ceases Prabhakar and merges with his family. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Gopal & Sobha.\n\nCast\nN. T. Rama Rao as Gopal\nSavitri as Sobha\nGummadi as Tirumala Rao\nRelangi as Bhadrachalam\nR. Nageswara Rao as Prabhakaram\nK. V. S. Sarma as Swamiji\nMahankali Venkaiah as Seshachalam\nJagga Rao\nSuryakantham as Nancharamma\nRajasulochana as Rita\nPushpavalli as Mahalakshmamma\n\nProduction\nInti Guttu is a remake of the Hindi film Munimji (1955), but differs in many respects: the hero disguises himself as an aged driver, unlike the original where he disguises as an accountant. An original creation to Inti Guttu was the patriarch's sister, who was not present in the Hindi version. In Munimji, the woman whom the patriarch secretly married swaps her newly born son with his deceased wife's child, but in Inti Guttu, the sister's husband interchanges the children.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMusic composed by M. S. Prakash. Lyrics were written by Malladi Ramakrishna Sastry.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nInti Guttu at IMDb"

Once, she accompanies his father to hunt and gets acquainted with an exiled prince Satyavanta, the son of a king Dyumatsena of Salwa Kingdom. He blew his fortune with the foe Rudrasena's backstab, left as the forest dwellers, and plucked the couple's eyes. Satyavantha & Savitri endear, and Savitri confirms her choice to the parents. As a flabbergast, Narada arrives and states Satyavantha will die 1 year after the wedding. Despite this, Savitri holds steady and announces to face the fact. So, Asvapati headed to Dyumatsena with bridal connections. Soon after the nuptial, Savitri proceeds to her in-laws's hermitage, relinquishing the luxury and serving them with adoration.

    "synopsis": "Alladin and the Wonderful Lamp, also known by its Telugu-language title Allauddin Adhbhuta Deepam, its Tamil-language title Allavudeenum Arputha Vilakkum, and its Hindi-language title Alladdin Ka Chirag, is a 1957 Indian fantasy film produced by M. L. Pathy on the Jai Sakthi Pictures banner and directed by T. R. Raghunath. The film stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Anjali Devi. It is an adaptation of the story of Aladdin from One Thousand and One Nights and filmed simultaneously in three different languages. Allavudeenum Arputha Vilakkum was released on 29 March 1957, and Allavuddin Adbhuta Deepam followed on 13 April. Alladin Ka Chirag was also released the same year.\n\nPlot\nJaffer, a cruel sorcerer, seeks world domination. Through his friend Yakub, he learns of a magic lamp containing a genie that grants any wish. The lamp is hidden in the Korakaram Caves and can be obtained only by a young man who bears seven moles on his right hand. That is Aladdin. Posing as Aladdin’s paternal uncle, Jaffer sends him to retrieve the lamp. After an adventurous journey, Aladdin finds the lamp, but when he refuses to give it to Jaffer, the enraged sorcerer seals him inside the cave. Using a magical ring Jaffer had given him for emergencies, Aladdin escapes and returns home. When he tells his mother, Fathima, what happened, she throws the lamp away in fear, and it becomes buried in their yard.\nSome time later, Aladdin falls in love with Princess Yasmin, the daughter of the Sultan of Baghdad. When he secretly enters the palace, he is caught and punished. Fathima pleads with the Sultan to allow her son to marry Yasmin, but the Sultan challenges Aladdin to present wealth equal to his own. While cleaning, Fathima finds the discarded lamp and releases the genie, who helps Aladdin amass immense riches. Impressed, the Sultan agrees to the marriage.\nMeanwhile, Jaffer discovers that Aladdin is alive. Disguised, he steals the lamp, captures Yasmin, and seizes Aladdin’s wealth. With Yakub’s help, Aladdin finds Jaffer’s fortress, rescues Yasmin, and defeats the sorcerer. He returns to Baghdad, where the Sultan names him his successor. In gratitude and wisdom, Aladdin frees the genie so the lamp can never again be misused.\n\nCast\nAdapted from Film News Anandan's database:\n\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao as Alladin\nAnjali Devi as Yasmin\nS.

Bhanumathi and N. T. Rama Rao with music composed by Ghantasala. The film is based on the epic of the same name by Gurajada Apparao.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins at Raja Mahendravaram, ruled by Rajaraja Narendra, who resides with his Queen Ratnangi and son Sarangadhara. He has two ministers: Singanna, a good Samaritan, and Ganganna, a diabolic. Sarangadhara turns jack of all trades with ethical & royal moralities at Nannayya Bhattu. During that time, riots arose when Rajaraja suspects Rangaraju, the ruler of Rangaseema. Ergo sends Sarangadhara as an emissary with his besties Singanna & Mandavya. Amid, he is acquainted with Chitrangi, the daughter of Rangaraju, who endears him at first sight. Following, Sarangadhara tackles the rift and backs. Rajaraja is on a quest to find the bride in Sarangadhara and selects Chitrangi. Being conscious of it, Chitrangi is on cloud nine, but Sarangadhara rejects it as he is already in a crush with Kanakangi, the daughter of a satrap. Exploiting it, Ganganna artifices by the tainting spirit of Rajaraja and lures him to knit Chitrangi. Hence, they perform the nuptial with his sword with deceit, and then fact appears. \nCurrently, Chitrangi is infuriated and seeks vengeance before proceeding to Raja Mahendravaram. At this, Rajaraja constructs a palace for her when she backs off Rajaraja on the pretext of a vow and waits for the shot to allure Sarangadhara. Parallelly, Rajaraja moves to hunt when Chitrangi knows Sarangadhara is fond of pigeon play. So, she steals one of the pigeons when Sarangadhara starts the game and attracts it, for which he enters her palace. Next, Chitrangi divulges the actuality and expresses her love, which he denies and quits when he forgets the knife & shoes. Meanwhile, Rajaraja returns when Chitrangi imputes Sarangadhara as an imposter who molests her. Moreover, his shoes & knife affirm her assumption when Rajaraja edicts to amputate Sarangadhara. However, Subuddhi & Mandavya make Sarangadhara guilt-free. By the time it is too late, Chitrangi also lands therein, charges Rajaraja for sinful actions, and commits suicide. During that plight, Siva appears as a sage and gives rebirth to Sarangadhara. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the crowning & marriage ceremony of Saranagadhara, and the place is adored as \"Sarangadhareswara temple\" at Rajahmundry till today.\n\nCast\nP.

    "synopsis": "Tenali Ramakrishna is a 1956 Indian Telugu-language political drama film produced and directed by B. S. Ranga based on Ch. Venkataramaiah's stage play of the same name. Produced for the banner Vikram Productions, it stars N. T. Rama Rao, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, V. Nagayya, P. Bhanumathi, and Jamuna in key roles. Ranga handled the cinematography with his brother-in-law B. N. Haridas while P. G. Mohan edited the film. Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy composed the soundtrack and background score.\nWritten by Samudrala Sr., Kannadasan, and Murugadasa, Tenali Ramakrishna narrates the story of the 16th-century Telugu poet and scholar of the same name, and his life as a member of the court of Sri Krishnadevaraya, the king of the Vijayanagara Empire. Using his wits, Ramakrishna manages to save Krishnadevaraya from attacks on his empire by the Bahmani Sultanate. The rest of the film is about Ramakrishna's efforts to save Krishnadevaraya from the courtesan Krishnasani, a spy, and convincing Mughal Emperor Babur against extending support to the Sultanate in the war.\nProduced as a bilingual film shot simultaneously in the Telugu and Tamil languages with a slightly altered cast, Tenali Ramakrishna was filmed in and around Revathy Studios at Madras. It was released on 12 January 1956 to mixed reviews from critics who criticised the historical inaccuracies portrayed in the film. Tenali Ramakrishna was a commercial success, won the President's Silver medal for the Best Feature Film in Telugu and the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film at the 4th National Film Awards. Its Tamil version, titled Tenali Raman, featured Sivaji Ganesan as the protagonist and was released on 3 February 1956. Tenali Ramakrishna was later remade in Kannada as Hasyaratna Ramakrishna in 1982 by Ranga himself but it was a commercial failure.\n\nPlot\nRamakrishna is a poet and scholar in the Telugu and Sanskrit languages whose talent is not recognised in his hometown Tenali. To earn a living, he migrates to Hampi with his wife Kamala and son Madhava. On his way to Hampi, he stops at a Kali temple. He is initially terrified looking at the goddess' idol and the animal sacrifices made to please her. That night, Kali appears before him and grants a boon: he must choose either wisdom or wealth. Ramakrishna opts for both, which angers Kali. She warns him that he might end up as a Vikatakavi (jester poet) whose wisdom is useful solely for entertaining others. Ramakrishna accepts this as a blessing and asks Kali to save him from further dangers. The goddess agrees and disappears.\nRamakrishna reaches Hampi and approaches Tatacharya, the royal priest of the Vijayanagara Empire, to find employment in the court of King Sri Krishnadevaraya. Neither Tatacharya nor his assistants help him, and he leaves dejected. However, he finds an opportunity when Krishnadevaraya is unable to distribute 17 elephants among three brothers as instructed in their deceased father's will. Ramakrishna solves the problem and Krishnadevaraya appoints him as a member of court. With his wit and loyalty, Ramakrishna soon earns the respect of all the court's members with the exception of Tatacharya who sees him as a problem.\nThe Deccan sultanates of Berar, Ahmednagar, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda—decide to wage a war on the Vijayanagara empire with united military forces. They send Kanakaraju, a spy, to Hampi where he meets Ramakrishna, who happens to be a distant relative. A few days later, Kanakaraju tries to assassinate Krishnadevaraya, and Tatacharya blames Ramakrishna for giving shelter to a spy. As Ramakrishna is about to be executed on the King's orders, he overhears a conversation between another spy and the court's astrologer. The spy bribes the astrologer to influence Krishnadevaraya to postpone the war on Bijapur so they have time to make proper preparations. Ramakrishna escapes and meets Prime Minister Timmarusu who helps him reveal the astrologer's intentions. The astrologer is killed, and Tatacharya, who believed in him in good faith, is accused of trying to backstab the king. Ramakrishna intervenes and Tatacharya is saved, improving their relationship.\nThe Bahmani Sultanate then sends the courtesan Krishnasani to Hampi. With her acclaimed dancing skills, she manages to attract the attention of Krishnadevaraya, who finds himself besotted by her wit and sensuousness. He issues orders that anyone who enters his private chamber will be beheaded and spends time with Krishnasani for months. Timmarusu and Ramakrishna learn that the Sultans are planning to take advantage of the King's inaccessibility and will soon launch a combined attack on Hampi. Worried about the state of affairs, Ramakrishna ignores the King's order and enters his abode dressed as a woman, but is ignored and expelled from the kingdom.\nMeanwhile, Krishnadevaraya's wife Tirumala Devi falls seriously ill, and he finally realises his mistakes. Once the King is back at his palace, Ramakrishna manages to enter Krishnasani's chamber again, this time under the guise of a saint. He catches her red-handed with her gang of spies, and signals to the hidden soldiers to surround her. She kills herself preferring a dignified death. Ramakrishna wishes to leave for Delhi to convince Emperor Babur not to send his elephantry to support the Sultanate in the war.\nRamakrishna reaches Delhi and meets Babur in the guise of an aged fakir. He sings his praises until he empties all the gold coins Babur has. Babur invites him to his palace to gift him properly. Ramakrishna goes to Babur's palace. He introduces himself as one of the innocent citizens of the Vijayanagara empire who will suffer if Babur extends his support to the unjust Sultanate. Babur is convinced and calls his elephantry back. Dismayed at the sudden turn of events, the Sultanate calls off the war. Krishnadevaraya learns about Ramakrishna's efforts in stopping the war from Timmarusu. Remorseful, Krishnadevaraya invites Ramakrishna to rejoin the court; he gladly agrees.\n\nCast\nMale actors\nN.

S. Ranga wished to produce and direct a historical film based on the life of the 16th century Telugu poet and scholar Tenali Ramakrishna, one of the Ashtadiggajas (a collective title given to the eight Telugu poets in the court of Krishnadevaraya, which literally translates as \"eight great elephants\"). He planned it as a bilingual film to be filmed simultaneously in the Telugu and Tamil languages but with a slightly altered cast. Ranga collaborated with Samudrala Sr., Kannadasan and Murugadasa on the basic script for both the versions. They decided to adapt Ch. Venkataramaiah's Kannada-language stage play Tenali Ramakrishna into the film, instead of following H. M. Reddy's script for the 1941 Telugu directorial of the same name. Ranga titled the film Tenali Raman in Tamil.\nVenkataramaiah's play was comical in nature, and focused on the life and times of Ramakrishna. Fearing it would fail to translate on-screen effectively, Samudrala and Kannadasan decided to incorporate political elements during the rule of Krishnadevaraya. While Samudrala focused on the administrative aspects of Krishnadevaraya, Kannadasan opted to \"humanise\" the king by writing scenes related to his personal life and preferences. Tenali Ramakrishna was filmed in and around Revathy Studios in Madras, due to the floors of Ranga's production company Vikram Studios still being under construction. V. S. Rangachari, the film's associate director, assisted Ranga in directing the Telugu version.\n\nCast and crew\nRanga cast Akkineni Nageswara Rao to play Ramakrishna in Telugu, with Sivaji Ganesan replacing him in the Tamil version.N. T. Rama Rao and V. Nagayya were signed to play Krishnadevaraya and his minister Timmarusu, respectively. Mukkamala played the role of Tatacharya, the kingdom's royal priest. He was replaced by M. N. Nambiar in the Tamil version.\nRanga approached Bhanumathi Ramakrishna to play Krishnasani. Initially uninterested, Bhanumathi accepted the offer because of Ranga's association as a cinematographer for the films produced by her production company Bharani Pictures. Tenali Ramakrishna is the only film where Bhanumathi shared the screen simultaneously with both Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao. Vangara Venkata Subbaiah, Sandhya, R. Balasaraswathi Devi, Jamuna, Lakshmikantha, Venkumamba and Master Venkateshwar were cast in key supporting roles. Kamaraju appeared as Emperor Babur, and Mikkilineni made a brief appearance as Ramakrishna's relative Kanakaraju.\nViswanathan–Ramamoorthy were signed to compose the soundtrack and background score for both the versions. Ranga's brother-in-law B. N. Haridas worked as the cinematographer. However, Ranga was credited as the film's director of photography with Haridas. P. G. Mohan edited the film. Vali and Ganga were the art directors, and V. K. Srinivasan was the film's production manager. Chopra and Gopalakrishnan choreographed the dance sequences.\n\nMusic\nViswanathan–Ramamoorthy composed the soundtrack and background score, with Samudrala penning the lyrics for the songs and poems. Ghantasala, Madhavapeddi Satyam, P. Leela, P. Susheela, Balasaraswathi and A. P. Komala were the soundtrack's playback singers. Bhanumathi provided vocals as the playback singer for the songs featuring her. The song \"Chesedi Yemito\" was composed using the Sindhu Bhairavi raga. \"Neevega Raja Neevega\" and \"Jhan Jhan Kankanamulu\" are based on the Shanmukhapriya and Shuddha Saveri ragas. The song \"Chandana Charchita\", an ashtapadi adapted from Gita Govinda written by the Sanskrit poet Jayadeva, was composed using the Mohanam raga. When Ghantasala refused to take money for the 14 poems he sang, Ranga went to his home and gave his wife Savithri Ghantasala one hundred rupees for each poem. Ramakoti, who played a washer man in the film, sang the song \"Akathayipilla Mooka\".\nThe soundtrack, marketed by His Master's Voice, was released on 1 December 1956. The songs received positive reviews from the critics after the film's release. A review dated 27 January 1956 in Swatantra said: \"The songs help the film greatly, with all the singers performing very well, though the ones sung by Bhanumathi could have been much better [sic]\". The reviewer also found the background score \"generally effective\", and \"exceptional\" at times. Zameen Raithu, in its review dated 10 February 1956, praised Samudrala for adapting Jayadeva's ashtapadi and other complicated poems and not \"compromising\" for the common audience to understand. However, the reviewer was critical of the grammatical and pronunciation errors made by the singers and actors in the film. The songs \"Theerani Naa Korikale\", \"Chandana Charchita\", \"Jhan Jhan Kankanamulu\", and \"Gandupilli Menumarachi\" gained popularity post release.\nTrack listing\n\nRelease\nTenali Ramakrishna was released on 12 January 1956, with an approximate total length of 18,292 feet (5,575 m) in 20 reels, with a running time of 169 minutes. Navayuga films distributed the film in the Vijayawada, Guntakal, and Madras areas. The Nizam area distribution rights were acquired by All India Corporation Limited. Due to technical issues, the film had a delayed theatrical release on 13 and 14 January 1956 in 13 centres across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Tenali Raman was released on 3 February 1956, with both the versions being commercially successful.\n\nReception\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Swatantra, in its review dated 27 January 1956, wrote that the film was paced evenly until the end, and Samudrala's writing was one of the biggest strengths of the film. The reviewer praised Nageswara Rao's performance and dialogue delivery, but was critical of Rama Rao and Bhanumathi, noting that the latter was very \"ill at ease\" playing Krishnasani which was \"surprising\" given that the role was in her comfort zone. Zamin Ryot gave a negative review, writing that the film was disappointing and criticised the climax as the film's weakest link. In its review dated 10 February 1956, Zamin Ryot wrote that Ranga has a great vision which cannot be ignored, and an eye for subtle and innuendo-free comedy, calling Samudrala's writing and screenplay praiseworthy. The reviewer added that the characterisations were ill-developed, with Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao salvaging the film to an extent, though Bhanumathi struggled in portraying the grey shades with authenticity.\nThe film was also criticised for being historically inaccurate. Swatantra noted that Ramakrishna is given credit for solving the problem of distributing 17 disputed elephants among three brothers, though this was actually done by Timmarusu. Zamin Ryot was very critical of the portrayal of Ramakrishna as a staunch Sri Vaishnavite, while he was a Telugu Shaivite Brahmin with the alternate name Ramalinga. The reviewer noted that the depiction of the clean-shaven Ramakrishna, a 6000 Niyogi Brahmin by birth, was inaccurate for the period as Niyogis always sported a moustache in the 14th century.\n\nAccolades\nTenali Ramakrishna won the President's Silver medal for the Best Feature Film in Telugu and the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film at the 4th National Film Awards. The film was the second South Indian film to win the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film.\n\nRemake\nTenali Ramakrishna was remade by Ranga into the Kannada language again in 1982 as Hasyaratna Ramakrishna, starring Anant Nag and Srinath as Ramakrishna and Krishnadevaraya. Unlike the original, the remake was a commercial failure  with critics specifying that the audience did not accept Ramakrishna dominating Krishnadevaraya throughout the film.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nTenali Ramakrishna at IMDb"

    "synopsis": "Santosham (transl. Happiness) is a 1955 Telugu-language drama film, produced by M. Somasundaram under the Jupiter Pictures banner and directed by C. P. Deekshith. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao, Anjali Devi and Jamuna, with music composed by Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy. It is a remake of the Tamil film Velaikari (1949) and it was simultaneously made in Hindi as Naya Aadmi (1956) with Anwar Hussain  replacing Jaggayya and Gope replacing Relangi, respectively.\n\nPlot\nZamindar Dayanidhi (R. Nagendra Rao) is a deceitful vicious miser whose profession is to take advantage of the destitute by giving loans and taking the authority on them. Sundaraiah (Vadlamani Viswanathan) is a poor man who took a loan from Dayanidhi for his son Anand's (N.T. Rama Rao) higher studies. Dayanidhi deceives him and eventually auctions off his home, resulting in Sundaraiah committing suicide.\nAnand comes back to town, meets his childhood friend Madan Mohan (Jaggaiah), and is shocked to see his father dead. He reads the suicide note and realizes Dayanidhi's cruelty. He works an odd job for money, despite being a law graduate. When he gets fired from his job, Anand becomes depressed but copes with the help of Mohan. Enraged, Anand makes an aborted bid to kill the Zamindar and while fleeing, he and Mohan stumble upon the corpse of an England-returned rich young man Paramanand (again N. T. Rama Rao), who resembles Anand. On Mohan's advice, Anand takes his place. They are successful in making Paramanand's blind mother believe that Anand is Paramanand. Anand is shocked to hear that the mother has arranged her son's marriage with Dayanidhi's vainglory, class-conscious daughter Sarasa (Jamuna). Mohan persuades Anand to accept the proposal, and the marriage is performed. Mohan and Anand scheme a plan on how to seek revenge against Dayanidhi for Anand's father's death. Meanwhile, Sarasa is dismayed that Anand does not love her and dislikes his behavior.\nMohan and Anand seek to mentally torture Dayanidhi and reform him. One day, the two find out about the love affair between Dayanidhi's son Murthy (Ramasarma) and his servant-maid Amrutham (Anjali Devi). They relay this to Dayanidhi to cause a rift between the father and son. Dayanidhi argues with Murthy and is disheartened to hear that he wishes to marry Amrutham. Enraged, Dayanidhi tries to kill Amrutham by torching her hut. However, she is shifted out of town by Anand himself and ends up in a hospital. The hospital's doctor advises her to take shelter at an insane man Parvatalu's (Relangi) house while also curing him of his illness by acting as his daughter, and she accepts. Meanwhile, Anand and Mohan seek to ruin Dayanidhi's public reputation with cheap behavior. When Dayanidhi argues, Anand quits the house and forcibly takes Sarasa with him. He lives with Sarasa in a small house and makes her do all the household work to reform her.\nMeanwhile, Murthy is disheartened to hear of Amrutham's supposed death and becomes a wanderer. He tangles with a fake-godman criminal, and in a fight, the criminal accidentally dies and Murthy is accused of murder. Anand permanently takes up a disguise to argue his case in court. Anand successfully gets Murthy acquitted. Anand also reunites Murthy with Amrutham who is now adopted by a cured Parvatalu, and seeks to perform their marriage. The proposal is accepted by Dayanidhi and the marriage takes place. At the wedding venue, police show up to arrest Dayanidhi for murdering Amrutham. Dayanidhi finally learns that money is not everything and tries to commit suicide but is stopped by Mohan and a disguised Anand. However, Anand produces Amrutham at the wedding venue and sends away the police. When Dayanidhi expresses his gratitude, Anand finally removes his disguise and reveals the truth. He shows everyone that Dayanidhi is a criminal and the culprit of his father's death, and wishes to leave now that he has completed his revenge. However, Dayanidhi expresses resentment and begs forgiveness. Sarasa also pleads the same and warms up to Anand. The film ends on a happy note with the reunion of the whole family.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\nSince Bombay-based director C.P. Deekshith didn't know Telugu, T. Hanumantharao assisted him as a dialogue director. The film was initially titled Andarikosam.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMusic composed by Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy. Lyrics were written by Samudrala Sr-Samudrala Jr. The hit numbers include- \"Theeyani Haayi Ee Reyi\" and \"Unnarunnarunnaru\".\n\nRelease\nBoth versions were released a week apart and both fared well.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSantosham at IMDb"

    "synopsis": "Donga Ramudu (transl. Ramudu, the thief) is a 1955 Indian Telugu-language drama film co-written and directed by K. V. Reddy. It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Savitri, Jamuna, and Jaggayya with music composed by Pendyala. The film was produced by D. Madhusudhana Rao under the Annapurna Pictures banner.\nDonga Ramudu is the debut production of Annapurna Pictures. Released on October 1, 1955, the film became a super hit. Donga Ramudu established Annapurna Pictures as a top banner. The film was archived in the curriculum of the Film and Television Institute of India. Donga Ramudu was dubbed in Tamil as Thiruttu Raman (1956) and was commercially successful. It was later remade in Hindi as Man-Mauji (1962) and again in Tamil as Vasanthi (1988).\n\nPlot\nA young boy Ramudu frequently gets into trouble with his mischievous behavior. He dotes upon his sister Lakshmi. One day when his destitute mother Subbamma is ailing and needs expensive medications, he steals the medicine and lands at a reformatory. After the death of Subbamma (Hemalatha), Lakshmi is sent to an orphanage.\nYears later, a grown-up Ramudu (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) is released and goes in search of his sister. He rescues a child, the son of a rich miser Veerabhadrayya (Relangi) from a local thug Babulu (R. Nageswara Rao) and gets the job of a servant in his house. Here, Ramudu gets acquainted with a vegetable vendor Seeta (Savitri) and they fall in love. After some time, he learns the whereabouts of Lakshmi (Jamuna). He pretends to be a wealthy businessman and promises to pay her college fees. To raise the amount, he tries to rob Veerabhadrayya but is caught and sentenced.\nLakshmi is ashamed of her brother and leaves the orphanage. She falls into the clutches of Babulu but Seeta rescues her. Lakshmi is hospitalized where she meets a benevolent doctor Mohan (Jaggayya) who helps the poor. Lakshmi finds shelter in his house. Impressed by her good nature, Mohan decides to marry her. After serving his sentence, Ramudu meets Seeta who is angry with him but forgives him after he explains his predicament. By chance, Ramudu is hired as a driver at Mohan's house where he encounters Lakshmi. He is very pleased with her marriage and warns her not to let anyone know that he is her brother. Fearing that his past might jeopardize her happiness, he decides to leave. Ramudu is charged with theft at Mohan's home. As a result, he is insulted and kicked out. Lakshmi remains silent due to the promise.\nVeerabhadrayya is displeased about Mohan's marriage to Lakshmi as he had wished to get his daughter married to Mohan. When he recognizes Lakshmi as Ramudu's sister, he decides to reveal her identity. Learning of his plan, Ramudu threatens him and silently attends his sister's wedding. Taking advantage of the situation, Babulu robs and murders Veerabhadrayya. Ramudu is indicted for the crime. Lakshmi comes forward, to tell the truth, that Ramudu is her brother and was present at the wedding during the time of the murder. Meanwhile, Seeta brings forward evidence that Babulu is the real murderer. The movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Ramudu and Seeta.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\nAfter Akkineni Nageswara Rao became a major movie star, his friend and mentor, Dukkipati Madhusudana Rao felt it was the right time to launch their own production company. They established Annapurna Pictures (P) Ltd, named after Madhusudana Rao’s stepmother. Besides Madhusudana Rao and Nageswara Rao, the company had other partners. P. S. Ramakrishna Rao and P. Pullayya who gave memorable hits with Nageswara Rao were approached to direct Annapurna's debut venture but could not commit due to various reasons. Nageswara Rao had a wish to work with K. V. Reddy and when they met him, K. V. Reddy obliged on condition that they have to wait till he completed Pedda Manushulu (1954).\nD. V. Narasaraju, the writer of Pedda Manushulu was chosen to pen the story and dialogues. Since he was directing Nageswara Rao for the first time, K. V. Reddy thought it should be different from the actor's earlier films. He suggested that he pen a story on a brother-sister sentiment with the brother going to any extent, even giving up his life for the sake of his sister. Madhusudana Rao recollected a short story, Loving Brothers that he had read in an anthology of American short stories. In the story, the elder brother commits robberies to educate his younger brother. Taking that point replacing the younger brother with a sister, Narasaraju, Madhusudana Rao and K. V. Reddy wrote the story of Donga Ramudu.\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao and R. Nageswara Rao took special coaching from stunt director Raghavulu for the wrestling scene in the film. K. V. Reddy’s children were featured in the song \"Bhale Thatha Mana Bapuji\".\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMusic was composed by Pendyala. \n\nTelugu songs\nLyrics were written by Samudrala Sr in a month.\n\nTamil songs\nLyrics were by Kanaga Surabhi and Kannadasan. All the tunes for all the songs and singers for both languages are the same.\n\nRelease and Reception\nThe film released on October 1, 1955 and became a super hit. Donga Ramudu was dubbed in Tamil as Thiruttu Raman (1956).\n\nLegacy\nDonga Ramudu established Annapurna Pictures as a top banner in Telugu cinema. It was later remade in Hindi as Man-Mauji (1962) and again in Tamil as Vasanthi (1988).\nNarasaraju created catchy words such as ‘gas’ for telling a lie which remains popular to this day. R. Nageswara Rao’s famous dialogue, Babulu gaadi debba ante Golconda abba anali, also became popular. The film was archived in the curriculum of the Film and Television Institute of India for its excellence in filmmaking.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDonga Ramudu at IMDb"

Prasad has taken care of direction supervision. It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Savitri and music composed by Susarla Dakshina Murthy. The film is the debut of legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar in the Telugu film industry. The song Nidura Pora Thammuda was a trend setter in being a theme song that unites lost siblings. The film was remade in Tamil as Marakka Mudiyuma?.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with Rangaiah, a laborer who has two children, and his wife passes away, giving birth to a third. Beyond that, Rangaiah loses his eyesight in an accident, and 3 children are left to fend for themselves by Rangaiah. Due to misfortune, the second one, Ramu, is lost on the train and joins a drama troupe. The eldest, Lakshmi, finds shelter at the wealthy Narahari Rao's residence with the help of his son Madhu. One day, unfortunately, the younger Babu is abducted by a thief for a locket when Mastan Baba, a wrestler, rescues and rears him. Years pass, Ramu becomes a stage artist, and his proprietor compels him to knit his daughter. Frightened, Ramu escapes and lands at a tycoon, Subbaraju's residence, where he acquires a cooking pot, and Sarada, the daughter of Subbaraju, falls for him. Parallelly, Madhu & Lakshmi share a bond beyond, who promises to espouse her. Knowing it, Narahari expelled Lakshmi immediately after he proceeded abroad. Before dying, Mastan Baba reveals Babu's birth secret and handovers the locket. After that, he saves Narahari's daughter Sarala from goons, and she crushes him. Here, Narahari angers as he aspires to perform at Sarala's wedding with his nephew Shakaram, so he detached them too.\nMeanwhile, Subbaraju learns about Ramu & Sarada's love affair, approves their alliance, and promotes Ramu as General Manager. After returning, Madhu finds out about his father's violation of Lakshmi. Right now, she works as a daily worker at Subbaraju's factory, where Manager Kamayya tries to molest her when Babu rescues her. In the quarrel, she recognizes him by the locket. Following, to take revenge, Kamayya throws Lakshmi into debt and asks her to vacate the house. So, to repay the amount, Babu heists a beggar and its Rangaiah. Whereat, Lakshmi returns it, chiding Babu, and shelters Rangaiah. During that plight, Lakshmi moves for Ramu's help, but he is reluctant. Depressed, Lakshmi moves on to singing their childhood song when Ramu recognizes her. So, he rushes, pleads pardon, and narrates their story, which Rangaiah overhears. However, he is quiet out of contrition when Babu arrives, strikes Ramu, and unfortunately, Lakshmi is wounded. Immediately, they shift her to a hospital where Madhu treats her. Accidentally, Babu spots grief-stricken Sarala therein and consoles her. Discerning the situation, Subbaraju silently arranges the weddings of siblings. Determining it, Narahari lands at the venue when Rangaiah bars him and divulges the truth about where the children mingled with their father. Looking at their affection, Narahari also realizes.

    "synopsis": "Jayasimha is a 1955 Indian Telugu-language swashbuckler film directed by D. Yoganand and written by Samudrala Jr. It was produced by N. T. Rama Rao and his brother N. Trivikrama Rao for their production company National Art Theatre. The film features Rama Rao playing the eponymous protagonist along with Anjali Devi and Waheeda Rehman (making her debut as an actress in Indian cinema) in the lead roles, supported by an ensemble cast of S. V. Ranga Rao, Kantha Rao, Gummadi, Relangi and Rajanala Kaleswara Rao.\nInspired from the Telugu novel Veera Pooja, the film tells the story of Jayasimha (played by Rama Rao), the crown prince of Malawa kingdom who escapes assassination attempts from his uncle Rudrasimha (Ranga Rao), who wishes to ascend the throne as the next king. Jayasimha leaves Malawa assuming a new identity and leads the life of a soldier in Magadha kingdom, falling in love with its princess Padmini (Waheeda) and befriending Kalindi (Anjali Devi), the daughter of an old disabled general Ranadheer (Gummadi). The rest of the film focuses on the aftermath of Rudrasimha finding out Jayasimha's new life in Magadha and seeking his life.\nD. V. S. Raju, who assisted Rama Rao during the production of Pichi Pullayya (1953) and Thodu Dongalu (1954), joined the film's crew as an associate producer. T. V. Raju composed the film's soundtrack and score; M. A. Rehman was signed as the cinematographer and G. D. Joshi edited the film. Jayasimha's principal photography was conducted at sets erected by Thota at Vijaya Vauhini Studios, Madras (now Chennai).\nJayasimha was released theatrically on 21 October 1955, cashing in on the Vijayadasami festival holidays. Upon release, the film was a commercial success, completing a 100-day run in 6 centres, 169-day run in Vijayawada and Guntur, and a 175-day run in Bangalore. It was later dubbed into Tamil in the same year, with the title Jayasimman.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins in the Malwa kingdom, whose ruler Amarasimha, while ailing, entrusts Prince Jayasimha's liability to his sibling Rudrasimha & his benevolent wife, Durgadevi. However, the spiteful Rudrasimha always urges for the throne. Durgadevi raises Jayasimha under the light of love with her son Vijayasimha, who is devoted to his brother. Years pass, Jay & Vijay turn into gallants, and it is time to crown him. It begrudges Rudrasimha, who ruses to assassinate Jayasimha. Being conscious of it, Jayasimha silently quits the Kingdom, surrendering it to his uncle. Yet, Rudrasimha commissions his henchman Chandrasena, determining that no enemy should be left. Vijay learns of his father's plot and walks to shield his brother.\nMeanwhile, in the forest of the Magadha kingdom, Jayasimha secures Princess Padmini from the dacoits when they crush. He is introduced as Bhavani Prasad and moves into their Kingdom. Therein, an old disabled general, Ranadheer, shelters him and befriends his son Budhimathi, & daughter Kalindi. Currently, their country is facing a gigantic battle with bandits' rebellion, who captured Emperor Raghuveer. Jayasimha proceeds to the fortress; with the aid of Padmini, he enrolls in the army and safeguards the King. Ergo, he has given with the great honor of a satrap. Here, the commander-in-chief, Mahaveer, is enraged at Jayasimha's big hit and Pamini's endearment towards him. Parallelly, Kalindi also falls for Jayasimha and, thus, creates a rift between him & Padmini to win her love. Later, she regrets that Jayasimha considers her a sibling. \nChandrasena then tracks down Jayasimha's whereabouts, who mingles with Mahaveer and abducts him with Padmini. Kalindi follows the duo and safeguards them by sacrificing her life. Besides, Mahaveer forcibly conspires to knit Padmini when Jayasimha assaults him. Unfortunately, the miscreants capture Jaya Simha when a man with a veil protects them, and Jayasimha kills Mahaveer. Now, Rudrasimha is about to onset on Magadha when Durgadevi bars him, but he deafens his ears by shooting her down. Jayasimha alone enters the battlefield and bows his head before his uncle. On the verge of Rudrasimha slaying him, the man in the veil stabs him. As a flabbergast, he uncovers him as Vijayasimha. At last, remorseful Rudrasimha pleads pardon from Jay & Vijay. Finally, the movie ends happily with Jayasimha's crowing ceremony.\n\nCast\nAnjali Devi as Kalindi\nN. T. Rama Rao as Jayasimha / Bhavani\nWaheeda Rehman as Padmini\nS. V.

T. Rama Rao was depressed because of the commercial failure of his previous film Thodu Dongalu (1954), which he produced along with his brother N. Trivikrama Rao and Atluri Pundarikakshayya. The failure prompted Rama Rao to contemplate quitting film production, until Trivikrama Rao and Pundarikakshayya convinced him to try making a swashbuckler film rooted in folklore. The financial success of Pathala Bhairavi (1951), Chandirani (1953) and Rechukka (1954)—all starring Rama Rao in the lead role and set in the same genre—further influenced their decision. Most of the principal crew of Thodu Dongalu, including its director D. Yoganand and writer Samudrala Jr., were retained for this film. Rama Rao advised Samudrala Jr. to loosely adapt the novel Veera Pooja. However, the same was not acknowledged in the film's credits.\nThe film was titled Jayasimha and was produced for Rama Rao's production company National Art Theatre. While Rama Rao decided to play the eponymous protagonist, Anjali Devi and Waheeda Rehman were cast as the female leads Kalindi and Padmini respectively. Jayasimha was Waheeda's debut as an actress, after her cameo appearances in Kanyadanam (1954) and Rojulu Marayi (1955); she was trained by Pundarikakshayya himself and her lines were dubbed by Sowcar Janaki. For the role of Vijayasimha, Jayasimha's brother, the makers approached Akkineni Nageswara Rao who could not accept the offer because of scheduling conflicts. Jaggayya was considered, but Gummadi (who was cast as Ranadheer, Kalindi's father) recommended Kanta Rao for the role. Rama Rao agreed, and this was Kanta Rao's second collaboration with the former after Vaddante Dabbu (1954). S. V. Ranga Rao, Rajanala Kaleswara Rao and Relangi were cast in key supporting roles. Anjali Devi was given the top billing in the film's opening credits and the song books, and was succeeded by Rama Rao and Ranga Rao.\nD. V. S. Raju, who assisted Rama Rao during the production of Pichi Pullayya (1953) and Thodu Dongalu, joined the film's crew as an associate producer. M. A. Rehman was signed as the cinematographer and G. D. Joshi edited the film. Jayasimha was shot in sets erected by Thota at Vijaya Vauhini Studios, Madras (now Chennai). Principal photography commenced on 19 January 1955 with a sequence filmed on Rama Rao and Relangi at Vauhini Studios, Madras. 'Stunt' Somu choreographed the action sequences. Kuchala Kumari and Rita composed the choreography for the dance sequences. The post-production activities were carried out at Vijaya Laboratories in Madras.\n\nMusic\n\nT. V. Raju composed the film's soundtrack and score, with lyrics written by Samudrala Jr., which was marketed by His Master's Voice. Satyam, who was known as 'Dholak' Satyam back then, assisted Raju during the composition of the songs. A. Krishnan was the film's audiographer, assisted by A. R. Swaminathan, C. Radhababu and V. Govinda Rao. On Satyam's advice, Raju decided to look for inspiration in Hindustani classical music. For the song \"Eenati Eehayi\", Raju took inspiration from Ghulam Mohammed's composition \"Zindagi Denewale Sun\" for Dil-E-Nadaan (1953). Similarly, for the pallavi of the song \"Manasaina Cheli Pilupu\", Raju used the tune of \"Chori Chori Aag Se\" composed by Shyam Sundar for Dholak (1951). Raju deviated from the tune of the originals, however, while composing the charanam for these songs. Another song \"Are Nee Sagamapa\" was adapted from a Hindi language composition of the same name written by Alla Rakha for Sabak (1950).\nThe song \"Nadireyi Gadichene\", filmed on Waheeda, was composed as a javali using the Begada raga. The duet \"Madiloni Madhurabhavam\", filmed on Rama Rao and Waheeda, was composed using the Mohanam raga. Raju composed the song \"Nadiyeti Painadachu\" in a Burra katha format which was well received by the critics. The soundtrack, consisting of 12 songs, was released on 31 December 1955 and received positive reviews. The song \"Jaya Jaya Sri Rama\" particularly gained popularity during the film's release and was played regularly in temples dedicated to Rama in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nRelease and reception\nJayasimha was released theatrically on 21 October 1955, cashing in on the Vijayadashami festival holidays. National Art Theatre released the film on their own across Andhra Pradesh, while the distribution rights for Nizam, Ceeded and Mysore regions were acquired by All India Talkie Distributors. Upon release, the film was a commercial success, completing a 100-day run in 6 centres, 169-day run in Vijayawada and Guntur, and a 175-day run in Bangalore. Jayasimha was later dubbed into Tamil the same year with the title Jayasimman.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nJayasimha at IMDb"

Confirming this, an astrologer advises him to move to a different place. Paramesam goes to Madras leaving behind his wife and son Samabadu. But the ghost persists to haunt him there too. One day, when he is lying unconscious on a road, a worker, Bheemanna takes him to his house. When Paramesam offers him money for having taken care of him, Bheemanna declines and advises him to give the money instead to Ramudu's family.

But the next day he wakes up as usual, and the doctor tells him that, since he is rid of the guilt, he is now hale and healthy. The story ends with Lokanatham handing over the mill to Paramesam.\n\nSoundtrack\n\"Unnateeru Neevunnadi Undi\" (Singer: Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao)\n\nAwards\n2nd National Film Awards (1954) - National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu - Certificate of Merit\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nTodu Dongalu at IMDb"

    "synopsis": "Aggi Ramudu (transl. Fire Ramudu) is a 1954 Telugu-language action film, produced and directed by S. M. Sriramulu Naidu. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Bhanumathi Ramakrishna and music composed by S M Subbayya Naidu. The film was simultaneously shot in Tamil as Malaikkallan (1954), with M.G. Ramachandran (MGR) and Bhanumathi in the lead roles.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins in Vijayapuri, where a wealthy landlord, Somanatham, lives with his daughter Sarada & sibling Kamakshamma. Once upon a time, Kamakshamma's husband, Kanakaiah, was slain by a bandit gang. So, Kasipati, his elder brother, seeks vengeance and wipes them out by camping in the forest, titling himself as Aggi Ramudu. After a while, Kanakaiah's son Kumar walks for an excursion to the same forest when Kasipati secures him from the tiger hunt. Recognizing Kumar as his brother's son, Kasipati rears & molds him as gallant. Presently, he turns into Aggi Ramudu, who hinders atrocities but is posed as a marauder and fills terror in that terrain. The Sub-Inspector & Head Constable are in a severe quest for him. However, everyone is unaware that Aggi Ramudu is an honorable Abdul Rahman disguise who resides in front of Somanatham's house. \nMeanwhile, Veeraju, Sarada's evil cousin, lusts to knit her, which Somanatham denies. So, he plots with haunted felon Kaaturi Kalaiah, the actual killer of this outrage, and abducts Sarada. Aggi Ramudu, in the guise of an old man, shields and carries her to his secret base. Firstly, Sarada loathes him, conscious of his true face, but later comprehends his virtue and endears him witnessing righteousness in his kingdom. Over time, he safely lands her home beyond the reach of Veeraju as Abdul Rahman. Here, the Sub-Inspector feels something fishy and questions Abdul Rahman when he promises & proves all charges against Aggi Ramudu are false. Besides, sly Mangalampadu Zamindar takes debt from Somanatham. To avoid it, he conspires with Veeraju and captures him with a call to repay. \nNow, Veeraju threatens Sarada to splice, showing danger to her father's life. Hence, Sarada proceeds to him, where Veeraju tries to molest her when his amour Janaki, whom he hoodwinked bars. Tragically, Veeraju slaughters her. Eventually, Aggi Ramudu arrives and guards Sarada. In the attire of Abdul Rahman, he saves Somanatham, too, with the aid of the Sub-Inspector, and ceases baddies. Somanatham invites all to dinner the same night when Abdul Rahman forwards Aggi Ramudu & Sarada's wedding proposal, which makes Somanatham serious. Abdul Rahman divulges Aggi Ramudu's birth secret when Kamakshamma realizes he is her son, Kumar. At last, as a flabbergast, Abdul Rahman unveils himself as Aggi Ramudu & Kumar. Finally, the movie ends happily with the marriage of Aggi Ramudu / Kumar & Sarada.\n\nCast\nN. T.

Prasad has taken care of supervision. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, C. Lakshmi Rajyam and S. V. Ranga Rao, with music composed by C. R. Subburaman & Susarla Dakshina Murthy. The film was later remade in Tamil as Velaikari Magal by the same banner and director.\n\nPlot\nRamaiah is a horse-cart driver, his wife Lakshmi works as a maid at Zamindar Badrinath, and the couple has a son, Subbadu. Since Badrinath is perturbed as childless, he decides to remarry. At this, his ruffled wife, Parvatamma, enacts a fake pregnancy under the guidance of her elder Ramarao. At the same time, Lakshmi is again conceived when Ramarao schemes to pose her baby as Parvatamma's. Here, Ramaiah suspects the infidelity of Lakshmi as Ramarao becomes frequent to their house and expels her from holding Subbadu. She shelters at Ramarao's residence, delivers a baby girl, and quits. Ramaiah remarries Durga, who elopes with a stage actor after throwing Subbadu into a stream. Dejected, Lakshmi attempts suicide when she finds her son fortuitously and saves him. After Durga quits, Ramaiah turns into an ascetic. Years roll by, and Lakshmi's daughter Kamala grows up as vainglory under the pampering of Parvatamma and loves Ramarao's son, Premnath. But Premnath's mother, who is aware of actuality, opposes it. Subbadu / Subbarao is molded into a lawyer of repute by his mother. After a few twists from here on, all ends up well. Ramaiah returns home, and the family is reunited.\n\nCast\nN. T. Rama Rao as Ramaiah\nC. Lakshmi Rajyam as Lakshmi\nS. V.

Raghu's mother Venkamma, sister Kamakshi, and brother-in-law Tata Rao depend on him. Very soft-natured Manjula suffers in the hands of shrewd Venkamma. Venu, the younger brother of Raghu stays back in the village. He is an honest, straightforward gentleman. Once Venu gets acquainted with Kamala and halts a night at his residence because her vehicle is in trouble.\nKamala's father Sundara Rao is a rich man in Vijayawada. She invites Venu to come to her house. Venu, when he goes to Vijayawada, observes how his sister-in-law is being harassed by his mother and sister. Venu and Kamala start loving each other. Venu gets a job with the help of her father.\nOn the other hand, Raghu is struggling hard to maintain the house. Moreover, Manjula joins for delivery in the hospital. Venu sends money after selling the property but Venkamma doesn't give that to Raghu. Raghu sells Manjula's wedding chain which also is snatched by Venkamma. Raghu loses his job and in frustration, he leaves the house. Venkamma and Kamakshi blame Manjula. Kamala informs Venu then he forcibly takes money from his mother and clears the debts. Venkamma tells Kamala that there is an affair between Venu and Manjula, which Kamala believes.\nManjula also leaves the house with the children writing a letter that Venu is like her brother, then Kamala realizes and asks for pardon from Venu. Manjula reaches Coimbatore. Sundara Rao asks Venu to marry Kamala, but he says he will marry only after getting back his brother and sister-in-law. Raghu also reaches Coimbatore.\nMeanwhile, Venu meets Thatha Rao, his sister's husband, and tells him that the only way to change his wife is through harsh behavior. Thatha Rao whips Kamakshi and Venkamma and makes them silent. Meanwhile, Sundara Rao purchases a mill at Coimbatore, and Venu and Kamala also shift there. The mill manager Ramesh has an evil eye on Kamala. Manjula sends her elder son Gopi to work in the mill.\nOnce Gopi meets Raghu, who is almost mad. Gopi forces him to work in the mill. Raghu becomes sick and Gopi brings him home when Manjula recognizes Raghu. Manjula goes to Sundara Rao to ask for some amount for Raghu's medicines; when he refuses, she beats him and steals money. At the same time, Kamala and Ramesh reach there, where they see Venu and suspect him. Ramesh calls for the police and Venu gets arrested.
