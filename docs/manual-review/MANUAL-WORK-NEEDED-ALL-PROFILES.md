## 💡 WORK STRATEGIES

### Strategy A: Focus Approach (Recommended)
**Complete one field for many profiles**
- Do Telugu Names Batch 2-5 (all 200 profiles)
- Then do Awards Batch 2-4 (all 60 profiles)
- Pros: Momentum, consistent workflow
- Cons: Some profiles remain incomplete longer

### Strategy B: Profile Approach
**Complete all fields for few profiles**
- Pick 20 profiles
- Do Telugu name + awards + family + social for each
- Pros: Creates many Premium profiles fast
- Cons: Slower overall progress

### Strategy C: Hybrid Approach
**Mix of both**
- Do Telugu Names Batch 2 (50 profiles)
- Do Awards Batch 2 (20 profiles)
- Do Family Trees (6 dynasties)
- Repeat
- Pros: Balanced progress
- Cons: Context switching

## 🚀 TOOLS & SHORTCUTS

### For Telugu Names:
- **Wikipedia**: First line usually has Telugu script
- **IMDb**: Sometimes shows native name
- **Google**: "[Name] Telugu" often works
- **Time**: 3-5 minutes per profile

### For Awards:
- **Wikipedia "Awards" section**: Primary source
- **IMDb Awards page**: Verification
- **Cross-check**: Multiple sources for accuracy
- **Time**: 15-20 minutes per profile

### For Family Trees:
- **Wikipedia "Personal life" section**: Family info
- **IMDb "Family" tab**: Relationships
- **Film family articles**: Wikipedia has many
- **Time**: 10-15 minutes per profile

### For Social Links:
- **Google**: "[Name] Twitter" or Instagram
- **Verify**: Blue check marks only
- **Official**: Avoid fan accounts
- **Time**: 3-5 minutes per active celebrity
