# No Recursive Planning Policy

**Generated**: January 25, 2026  
**Purpose**: Explicit policy prohibiting ClawDBot from planning its own planning (NO CODE)

---

## Policy Statement

ClawDBot **never plans its own planning**. It does not modify its own policies, schedules, or planning logic. ClawDBot's planning capabilities are fixed and immutable.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. No Self-Modification

#### Definition
ClawDBot never modifies its own code, policies, or configuration.

#### Application
- No policy modifications
- No rule changes
- No configuration updates
- No code modifications
- No self-improvement logic

#### Violations
- ClawDBot modifying its own policies
- ClawDBot changing its own rules
- ClawDBot updating its own configuration
- ClawDBot modifying its own code

---

### 2. No Recursive Loops

#### Definition
ClawDBot never creates recursive planning loops.

#### Application
- No planning of planning
- No optimization of planning
- No self-analysis of planning
- No recursive planning cycles

#### Violations
- ClawDBot planning its own planning
- ClawDBot optimizing its own planning
- ClawDBot analyzing its own planning
- ClawDBot creating recursive loops

---

### 3. Fixed Planning Logic

#### Definition
ClawDBot's planning logic is fixed and immutable.

#### Application
- Planning rules are fixed
- Planning algorithms are fixed
- Planning policies are fixed
- Planning configuration is fixed

#### Violations
- ClawDBot modifying planning rules
- ClawDBot changing planning algorithms
- ClawDBot updating planning policies
- ClawDBot modifying planning configuration

## Policy Enforcement

### Enforcement Mechanisms

1. **Immutable Design**
   - ClawDBot's planning logic is immutable
   - ClawDBot's policies are immutable
   - ClawDBot's configuration is immutable

2. **No Self-Reference**
   - ClawDBot does not reference itself
   - ClawDBot does not analyze itself
   - ClawDBot does not modify itself

3. **External Control**
   - Planning changes require external approval
   - Planning modifications are external
   - Planning updates are external

---

## Policy Violations

### Violation Types

1. **Self-Modification**
   - ClawDBot modifying its own policies
   - ClawDBot changing its own rules
   - ClawDBot updating its own configuration

2. **Recursive Planning**
   - ClawDBot planning its own planning
   - ClawDBot optimizing its own planning
   - ClawDBot analyzing its own planning

3. **Dynamic Planning**
   - ClawDBot modifying planning logic dynamically
   - ClawDBot adapting planning rules
   - ClawDBot evolving planning algorithms

### Violation Consequences

1. **Immediate Stop**: Stop violating process immediately
2. **Log Violation**: Log all violations for audit
3. **Alert Admin**: Alert administrators of violations
4. **Review Process**: Review process to prevent future violations

## Planning Architecture

### Safe Planning Flow

```
[ External Inputs ]
     ↓
[ ClawDBot Planner ]
     ↓ (Fixed planning logic, no self-modification)
[ Planning Outputs ]
     ↓ (Human approval)
[ External Execution ]
```

### ClawDBot's Role

- **Fixed Planning**: ClawDBot uses fixed planning logic
- **No Self-Modification**: ClawDBot never modifies itself
- **No Recursion**: ClawDBot never plans its own planning

### External Systems' Role

- **Human**: Modifies planning logic (if needed)
- **Cursor**: Executes approved plans
- **Runner**: Handles planning execution

---

## Policy Exceptions

### No Exceptions

This policy has **no exceptions**. ClawDBot never plans its own planning, regardless of circumstances.

---

## Relationship to Other Policies

### Related Policies

- **no_autonomy.md**: No recursive planning is a subset of no autonomy
- **no_state_mutation.md**: No recursive planning prevents state mutation
- **no_self_trigger.md**: No recursive planning prevents self-triggering

### Policy Hierarchy

- **no_autonomy.md** (parent policy)
  - **no_recursive_planning.md** (specific constraint)

---

## Policy Maintenance

### Policy Updates

- Policy updates require explicit approval
- Policy changes must be documented
- Policy changes must be tested
- Policy changes must be reviewed

### Policy Monitoring

- Monitor for policy violations
- Track policy compliance
- Generate policy compliance reports
- Review policy effectiveness
