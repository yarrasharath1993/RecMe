# Human Review Loop

**Generated**: January 25, 2026  
**Purpose**: Conceptual design for ClawDBot human review loop (NO CODE)

## Loop Characteristics

### Human Gate
✅ **YES** - All ClawDBot outputs require human review

### Automation Level
🟢 **READ-ONLY** - ClawDBot only generates review requests, does not perform reviews

### Risk Level
🟢 **LOW** - Read-only review request generation, no autonomous actions

### Frequency
- **Recommended**: Continuous (as outputs are generated)
- **Maximum**: Real-time (as outputs are generated)
- **Minimum**: Once per hour (batch review requests)
