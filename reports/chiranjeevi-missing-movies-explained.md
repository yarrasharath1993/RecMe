# Chiranjeevi Filmography: Why 137 and What’s Missing

## Why only 137?

**137** = number of canonical films (from your Batches 1–4) that **match** the DB:

- The movie exists in the DB **and**
- Chiranjeevi is attributed (hero / heroine / supporting_cast) **and**
- The script matched that DB row to your canonical title+year.

So the **total filmography count** you see (137) is “canonical entries that we successfully matched to the DB.”

## The 16 “Missing” Movies

These are in your canonical list but the verification script did **not** find a matching DB row (same movie with Chiranjeevi attributed). So they are “missing” from the **matched** set.

| # | Year | Canonical title | Role | Why “missing” / What to do |
|---|-----|------------------|------|----------------------------|
| 1 | 1978 | Manavoori Pandavulu | Supporting | Movie may not be in DB, or Chiranjeevi not in cast. Add movie or add him to supporting_cast. |
| 2 | 1979 | Kotta Alludu | Hero | Movie may not be in DB. Add movie with hero = Chiranjeevi. |
| 3 | 1979 | I Love You | Hero | Same – add movie or fix attribution. |
| 4 | 1979 | Idi Katha Kaadu | Supporting | Add movie or add Chiranjeevi to supporting_cast. |
| 5 | 1981 | 47 Natkal (Tamil) | Supporting | DB may have “47 Rojulu” (variant). Add Chiranjeevi to supporting_cast for that film if it’s the same. |
| 6 | 1985 | Puli | Hero | Not in fix list (to avoid matching “Pulijoodam”). Add “Puli” (1985) manually if it exists, or add movie. |
| 7 | 1989 | Mappillai | Cameo | May be in DB with different spelling; ensure Chiranjeevi is in supporting_cast (cameo). |
| 8 | 1992 | Aaj Ka Goonda Raaj (Hindi) | Hero | DB may have “Aaj Ka Goonda Raj”. Ensure Chiranjeevi is hero for that film. |
| 9 | 2000 | Hands Up! | Cameo | Ensure Chiranjeevi is in supporting_cast (cameo) for this film. |
| 10 | 2009 | Magadheera | Cameo | Ensure Chiranjeevi is in supporting_cast (cameo) for this film. |
| 11 | 2013 | Jagadguru Adi Shankara | Supporting | Ensure Chiranjeevi is in supporting_cast (supporting) for this film. |
| 12 | 2015 | Bruce Lee - The Fighter | Cameo | Ensure Chiranjeevi is in supporting_cast (cameo); watch for title spelling. |
| 13 | 2026 | Chiranjeevi-Srikanth Odela Project | Hero | Upcoming/TBA – add when the movie is in DB. |
| 14 | — | Hanuman (Telugu) | Voice over | Voice-over; no year. Add when in DB with Chiranjeevi in cast/crew. |
| 15 | — | Rudhramadevi | Narrator | Same – add when in DB. |
| 16 | — | Brahmāstra (Telugu) | Narrator | Same – add when in DB. |

So:

- **137** = matched (in DB + Chiranjeevi attributed + title/year matched).  
- **16** = “missing” = in canonical list but not in that matched set (movie missing, or not attributed, or spelling not matched).  
- **3** = “wrong role” (see below).

## The 3 “Wrong role” (canonical vs DB)

Canonical says **Supporting**, DB has them as **hero**:

| Movie | DB title | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Kaali (1980) | Kaali | Move Chiranjeevi from hero to supporting_cast (supporting) if canonical is correct. |
| Prema Tarangalu (1980) | Thathayya Premaleelalu | Same. |
| Tiruguleni Manishi (1981) | Tirugu Leni Manishi | Same. |

If you change these to supporting only, the “matched” count can go up and “wrong role” down (same 3 films would then count as matched).

## “In DB but not in canonical” (20)

These are movies in the DB where Chiranjeevi is attributed (hero or supporting_cast) but they are **not** in your Batches 1–4 list. Many are spelling variants of the same films (e.g. “Aaj Ka Goonda Raj”, “Thathayya Premaleelalu”, “47 Rojulu”). Some may be wrong attributions (e.g. “Family” 2020, “Aatagara” 2015) and worth reviewing.

---

## Summary

- **137** = films from your canonical list that are in the DB with Chiranjeevi attributed and matched by the script.  
- **16 missing** = canonical films not in that matched set (add movie, or add/fix attribution, or fix title matching).  
- **3 wrong role** = same films, but DB has hero instead of supporting; fix by moving to supporting_cast if you want them to count as “Supporting” in filmography.

If you want, we can: (1) add more title variants so more of the 16 match, or (2) add a small script to fix the 3 “wrong role” by moving Chiranjeevi from hero to supporting_cast for those three movies.
