## 8. DATABASE SCHEMA CONSIDERATIONS

### Cameo Appearances Table
Consider creating a dedicated `cameo_appearances` table for:
- Hands Up! (2000)
- Magadheera (2009)
- Aadavaallu Meeku Joharlu (1981)
- Prema Natakam (1981)
- Family (2020)
- Tayaramma Bangarayya (1979)

This keeps the `supporting_cast` field clean for significant characters.

### Antagonist Field
Consider adding an `antagonist` field or tag for:
- Ranuva Veeran (1981) - Tamil film
- Idi Katha Kaadu (1979) - Role: Subanakhar

These are essential to Chiranjeevi's early filmography and should be distinguished from regular supporting roles.
