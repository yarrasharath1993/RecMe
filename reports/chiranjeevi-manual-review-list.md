## 3. HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (CORRECTED - 0 items)

**IMPORTANT CORRECTION:** The previous "high priority fixes" were **INCORRECT** and have been removed.

The following films are **CORRECTLY ATTRIBUTED** as hero and should **NOT** be changed:

1. **Trinetrudu** (1988) - Main Lead ✓ (plays protagonist "Abhimanyu", produced by Anjana Productions but he is the star)
2. **Manchi Donga** (1988) - Main Lead ✓ (plays "Veerendra", classic Chiranjeevi action-entertainer)
3. **Rudraveena** (1988) - Main Lead ✓ (plays "Suryam", won National Film Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration)

**Correct Action:** 
- ✅ Keep these films in the `hero` field
- ✅ Do NOT remove from hero field
- ✅ May add to producer field only if database considers him a "de facto" producer via family banner (Anjana Productions), but primary contribution is as Lead Actor

## 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Missing Movies:
1. **Verify spelling variations** - Some "missing" films may be duplicates with different spellings
2. **Cross-reference with database** - Check if films exist with alternate spellings before adding
3. **Verify supporting roles** - Some listed as "supporting" may actually be lead roles or cameos

### For Wrong Attributions:
1. **High Priority Reattributions (5 films):**
   - Remove Chiranjeevi from hero/cast fields
   - Reattribute to correct actors as specified
   - **Special case:** Aatagara (2015) - Update to "Chiranjeevi Sarja" to prevent cross-linking

2. **Supporting Roles (16 films):**
   - Verify each attribution against reliable sources (IMDB, Wikipedia, TMDB)
   - Check for spelling variations
   - Verify cameo appearances are marked appropriately

3. **Check for Similar Name Confusions:**
   - Look for other films where Chiranjeevi Sarja or Dhruva Sarja might have been incorrectly mapped to the Megastar's profile
   - Check for other actor name confusions

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ **Execute reattributions:** Remove Chiranjeevi from 5 incorrectly attributed films and reattribute to correct actors
2. **Review missing movies:** Verify each of the 27 missing films, check for duplicates
3. **Review wrong attributions:** Verify the 16 remaining attributions, especially supporting roles and cameos
4. **Run comprehensive validation:** Use existing validation scripts to cross-check
