## 🔍 Decision Shortcuts

### APPROVE These (Most Likely Same Movie):

1. **High Match (90%+) + ±1 year**
   - "Bhaktha Markandeya" vs "Bhakta Markandeya" (94% match)
   - "Pratigna Palana" vs "Pratignapalana" (93% match)
   - "Dharma Chakkaram" vs "Dharma Chakram" (87% match)
   - **Why**: Just spelling/transliteration differences

2. **100% Match + 2 years**
   - "Aagraham" (Wiki: 1991, DB: 1993)
   - "Pelli Sandadi" (Wiki: 1997, DB: 1995)
   - **Why**: Likely release date confusion, same title

3. **Similar Telugu/Tamil Variants**
   - "Harichandra" vs "Harischandraa" (84% match)
   - "Bhale Ramudu" vs "Bhale Thammudu" (78% match)
   - **Why**: Common transliteration variants

---

### REJECT These (Likely Different Movies):

1. **Low Match (<80%) + Different Title**
   - "Settai" (Tamil) vs "Vettai" (Telugu) - Could be remake
   - "Ayya" vs "Arya" - Different movies
   - "Aryan" vs "Maryan" - Different movies
   
2. **When In Doubt**
   - Google: "[movie title] [actor name] [year] telugu"
   - Check if it's a Tamil/Hindi remake vs original
